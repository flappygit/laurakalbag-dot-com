# Hi, friend.

Hello! I’m a friendly designer originally from the UK, now living in Sweden. You’ll usually find me talking about ethical design, accessibility and inclusivity, privacy, web design and development.

I’m one half of [Ind.ie](https://ind.ie). We’re a not-for-profit striving for social justice in the digital age. We make [Better for iPhone and iPad](https://better.fyi) to protect you from tracking while you’re browsing the web. You should give it a go! My book [Accessibility For Everyone](https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone) is available in paperback and ebook from A Book Apart.
