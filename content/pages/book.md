I wrote a book! It’s called *Accessibility For Everyone*, and you can [buy it in paperback and ebook from A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone). Do you want to know about how to make your website more accessible to people with disabilities and other accessibility-related needs? My book helps you do just that.

For those more experienced in the web, *Accessibility For Everyone* can fill in the accessibility-sized gaps in your knowledge. And for people entirely new to making websites, it should help you get started on the right track. The book is aimed at web designers, developers, content strategists, copywriters, researchers, testers, and anybody else who makes websites.
