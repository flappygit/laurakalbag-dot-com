In February, there were two podcasts released featuring interviews with me! Both focused on ethical design and privacy.

## CodeNewbie

[CodeNewbie Season 3 Episode 4: What should developers know about online privacy? with Laura Kalbag](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/what-should-developers-know-about-online-privacy)

CodeNewbie is a fantastic podcast by Saron Yitbarek featuring interviews that introduce topics to people who are new to coding. You can [find the podcast on the CodeNewbie site](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/what-should-developers-know-about-online-privacy) along with a full transcript. One note is that I am continually muddling up the [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) acronym, calling the GDPR the “General Directive Privacy Regulation” when it is actually “General Data Protection Regulation.” Ugh, acronyms…

## Digital Mindfulness

[Digital Mindfulness #96 Ethical Data & Design with Laura Kalbag](https://digitalmindfulness.net/96-ethical-data-design-laura-kalbag/)

Digital Mindfulness is a podcast by Lawrence Ampofo looking at “digital experiences that focus on time well spent.” As I mentioned to Lawrence, I do not agree with a lot of the work in this area, so it made for an interesting interview which disagrees with many of the podcast’s previous guests. You can [find the podcast on the Digital Mindfulness site](https://digitalmindfulness.net/96-ethical-data-design-laura-kalbag/).
