In October, I found myself doing a lot more in Terminal than I’d done before, and I needed a computer with a faster processor, so I upgraded to a MacBook Pro. This means that my pimped-out Mid 2013 MacBook Air that I bought in December 2013 is now for sale. It’s in nearly-new condition, as it’s been kept in a shell case for almost all its (short) life. I used it for around 8 months. These are the specs:

* 13.3" Mid 2013 MacBook Air
* Processor 1.7GHz Intel Dual-Core Core i7
* Memory 8GB 1600MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM
* Hard Drive 512GB Flash Storage
* Fresh install of OS X Mavericks (easily upgraded to Yosemite)

It’s [exactly the same specs](http://support.apple.com/kb/SP678?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US) as a [fully-specced new MacBook Air](http://www.apple.com/mac/compare/notebooks.html), so you’ll be getting yourself a bargain. I paid £1,579 for it, and you can get it from Apple for £1,499. I’m looking for £1,100, and I’ll include free UPS delivery inside the UK.

If you’re interested, send me an email to me@laurakalbag.com, or tweet me @laurakalbag.
