Yesterday the [fourth episode of the Backendy podcast](http://backendy.com/2014/03/4-laura-kalbag/) was released, and I was the guest. It was lovely talking to Darren, partly because he’s been a great client for a while now, partly because I’ve been working on the podcast logo and site, and also because I think a podcast focusing on back-end development is a really good idea.
