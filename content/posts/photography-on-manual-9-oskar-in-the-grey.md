This week we’ve been looking more at natural light, and portraits with foreground detail. I took my trusty (actually incredibly unreliable) model, Oskar, out for a walk and hounded him with the camera. It was a very grey day, but with a lot of light.

I’m pleased with the depth from the different layers of cow parsley.">}}](/images/2015/05/DSCF4660-small.jpg)
