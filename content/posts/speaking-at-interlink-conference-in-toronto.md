*Sadly, [Interlink conference has been cancelled](http://interlinkconference.com" title="The End of Interlink). I’m gutted that I won’t be visiting Canada this year, but I totally understand how difficult it is to run a conference, especially if you’re trying to put on the best possible event for your attendees and speakers.*

<hr/>
This is very very exciting. In June, I’m going to speak at [Interlink conference](http://interlinkconference.com) in Toronto, Canada. The line-up is incredible, and I can’t believe I’m a part of it. It’s also my first trip to Canada, and only my second trip to North America. I can’t wait!
