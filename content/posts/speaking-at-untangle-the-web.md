Nothing quite like a last-minute post… Tonight I’m speaking at [Untangle the Web](http://www.meetup.com/Untangling-the-Web-London/events/119203762/) at Google Campus in London. I’m doing a talk on Design Theory for the Web where I do a whistle-stop tour through designing with typography, grids and colour on the web.

I also have a stinking cold so I’m going to be taking industrial quantities of Red Bull and a quarantine zone with me.

With primers in typography, grids and colour, I'll give you some simple rules for using visual design language to communicate with your users, making your sites more usable and much prettier." src="/images/2013/06/untangle-the-web.png" width="600" height="600" >}}](http://www.meetup.com/Untangling-the-Web-London/events/119203762/)

		I was looking forward to this when I heard you was speaking but at 5:20pm just over an hour before it starts I’m having to forfeit :(

If possible post up the video and/or slides so we can soak in your snot muffled wisdom.

Thanking ye’ :)
