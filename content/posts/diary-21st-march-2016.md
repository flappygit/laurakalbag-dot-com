It’s been a busy few weeks.

## Ethical Design Manifesto refresh

Last week we launched a refresh of the Ethical Design Manifesto, along with a video. As it was a short-ish video, I felt like I had no excuse but to do the captioning for it too. I couldn’t get Subtitle Horse (my usual favourite web software) working with the video, so I ended up using [Jubler](http://jubler.org/) instead.

It took a while to get my head around how to use the interface, but I found using the audio track from the video very useful, as I could sync the subtitles to the wave forms.

## Creative Mornings Malmö

On Friday I also gave my first ever talk in Malmö/Sweden. It was at Creative Mornings Malmö which had a lovely venue at Djäkne. The topic was “Change” and I spoke about Ethical Design, and why we need it. Aral took lots of bad photos of me, and one of them is below.

We’re settling into a good routine here in Malmö. We’re working from the office all week, 8:30-5ish, and doing a better job of taking time off during the evenings and weekends. It’s still tiring though! I underestimated the sheer cognitive load of dealing with an unfamiliar language and culture. Of course, everybody speaks English and is very kind and friendly. But just going to the supermarket, finding our way around, and learning how things work, takes a little more time and a little more effort. It’s a great adventure! But makes us well worn out at the end of every day.
