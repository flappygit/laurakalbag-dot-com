The first exercise we’ve been given is to capture a splash in a cup…

Even with the ISO jacked all the way up, this was the lightest I could get with the fastest possible shutter speed.">}}](/images/2015/05/DSCF3495-small.jpg)

Unfortunately my burst caught the splash a bit late.">}}](/images/2015/05/DSCF3521-small.jpg)

Though I wonder if the plant pot on the left spoils the composition.">}}](/images/2015/05/DSCF3527-small.jpg)

I’m not sure if square works either.">}}](/images/2015/05/DSCF3527-square-small.jpg)
