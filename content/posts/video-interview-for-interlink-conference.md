*Sadly, [Interlink conference has been cancelled](http://interlinkconference.com" title="The End of Interlink). I’m gutted that I won’t be visiting Canada this year, but I totally understand how difficult it is to run a conference, especially if you’re trying to put on the best possible event for your attendees and speakers.*

<hr/>
Last week I had [a chat with my friend Steve Fisher about my upcoming talk and workshop at Interlink conference and all things Canadian](http://interlinkconference.com/2014/03/laura-kalbag-design-gretzky-maple-syrup/). It was a fun way to end the day, and is complete with me doing a really terrible Canadian accent. It made me *even more* excited for [Interlink in June](http://interlinkconference.com), I can’t wait!

If you want to know a bit more about my workshop, I’ve put [some extra details in a blog post about the workshop](/design-theory-for-the-web-workshop-at-interlink-conference/ "Design theory for the web workshop at Interlink conference"), and you should check out the amazing [conference lineup](http://interlinkconference.com/conference/). It looks like there’s still some [Super Early Bird tickets](http://interlinkconference.com/register/) left, so you should grab them before they’re gone!
