Andy Clarke is on holiday for three weeks and has handed over the [Unfinished Business](http://unfinished.bz/) reins to [Ashley Baxter](http://insurancebyjack.co.uk/) and I. [This week’s episode](http://unfinished.bz/80) is all about business insurance for freelancers and small businesses. We talked about public liability, professional indemnity, business contents and copyright infringement. It was great because I got to ask Ashley loads of questions I forgot to ask when she was helping me get insured!

I’m not sure if the audio quality is as good as it usually is on Unfinished Business, as my editing skills are rather rusty… But this episode does feature a little bit of [Oskar](http://twitter.com/gigapup)!
