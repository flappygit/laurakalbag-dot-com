[This Thursday I’m speaking at Milton Keynes Geek Night](http://mkgeeknight.co.uk). Tickets sold out terrifyingly quickly, but I put that down to MKGN always being a great event.

I’m going to talk about self-discipline, it’s a new talk and so that makes me even more nervous than usual![{{< figure class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4101" alt="MKGN 7 - December 5th, 2013" src="/images/2013/12/mkgn.png" width="740" height="600" >}}](http://mkgeeknight.co.uk)
