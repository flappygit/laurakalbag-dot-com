I’m speaking at [CSS Summit 2013](http://environmentsforhumans.com/2013/css-summit/) about Sass For Designers. CSS Summit is a great online conference, meaning you can attend from anywhere in the world (hooray!)

There’s a huge amount of expert speakers across three days, with a day each dedicated to CSS3 Training, Advanced CSS and Preprocessors. I’m on the third day, covering the basics of Sass with ‘Sass for Designers’. The other talks on that day will cover Sass in more depth, with case studies and more advanced techniques, so I’m hoping to provide a useful introduction for those of us who are less familiar with programming.

		Hey Laura

Big fan of you in the industry. Small thing i just noticed on your comment form on your website (this one!). You don’t have an asterix on the Comment field, even though this is a required field. Annoying as this is the wordpress default, they should fix this also.

		What’s the point of using a comment form if you don’t leave a comment? Hmmm?
