For those who wanted my notes in an undigested, scatterbrained form, here’s images from my notebook. ([My digest is available too](http://laurakalbag.wpengine.com/digest-from-ampersand-conf/).)

I’m a mind-mapping fiend, so I try to link with arrows where I can. Where new points were begun I just moved to another space on the page, so forgive the random appearance! There’s not much point apologising for my bad handwriting, I can’t *really* help that (all caps is a pretty dodgy habit) but there are some points, notably during Jonathan Hoefler’s talk, where the lights were low so it’s particularly illegible there&#8230;

If you want full-ish size, just click the image to open it in a new tab!
