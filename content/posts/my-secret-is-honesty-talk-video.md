The lovely people at [Dare conference](http://2013.dareconf.com) have released [the video of my talk, My Secret is Honesty](http://2013.dareconf.com/videos/kalbag). It’s pretty much a longer, talk-version of [my latest column on A List Apart, “Open for Business.”](http://alistapart.com/column/open-for-business)

I’m not going to embed it here, because I want you to go to the website to watch it. The reason is that [there’s loads of great talks on there](http://2013.dareconf.com/videos "Dare conference videos"), and in order to help support Dare conference for next year, they’re taking donations. If you enjoy any of the videos, [please donate](http://2013.dareconf.com/videos#donate "Donate to Dare conference"). Dare didn’t make any money this this, but it was a phenomenal, heartwarming and groundbreaking event. I can’t wait for next year’s!
