Last week, the wonderful [Ashley Baxter](http://twitter.com/iamashley) asked me about how I got into public speaking. Ashley asked a few cool people, and published their [public speaking stories on the Insurance By Jack blog](http://insurancebyjack.co.uk/business-and-marketing/2014/05/20/how-to-get-started-with-public-speaking.html).

By the way, if you want business insurance, you really should get a quote from [Insurance By Jack](http://insurancebyjack.co.uk/).
