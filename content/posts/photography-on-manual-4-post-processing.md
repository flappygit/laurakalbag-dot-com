On my last day in Berlin, I took a lot more photos. Last night I started post-processing them, following Ashley’s email and video tutorials. Post-processing is an area where I have more experience, I’ve done a lot of Photoshopping in the past, but now I’m trying to achieve new effects using Lightroom, which is a very different animal!

I found it really hard to get the focus on my face, so my hands are slightly crisper.">}}](/images/2015/05/DSCF3765-original-small.jpg)

I adjusted the white balance so the lighting feels more natural. Using Ashley’s eye pop tutorial, I tweaked my eyes, but because my irises are almost black, I looked a bit scary if I lightened them!">}}](/images/2015/05/DSCF3765-small.jpg)

I also straightened it so the sign is along a properly horizontal line.">}}](/images/2015/05/DSCF3839-small.jpg)
