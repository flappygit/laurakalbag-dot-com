After [finishing the mentoring project last week](/mentoring-the-evaluation/ "Mentoring: the evaluation"), I had a chat with Craig Grannell about mentoring which he published on the .net website: “[Laura Kalbag: web designers should mentor newcomers](http://www.netmagazine.com/news/laura-kalbag-web-designers-should-mentor-newcomers-132847 "Laura Kalbag: web designers should mentor newcomers on .net magazine").”

It’s a good summary of the mentoring project and has extracts from a couple of testimonials by Sibylle and Phil.
