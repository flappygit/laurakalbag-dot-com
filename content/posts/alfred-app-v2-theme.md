Today I finally got around to playing with [Alfred v2](http://www.alfredapp.com/). This is the one OSX app I’ll allow to open on login, I use it to launch every app and find every file. I use it to work out maths for my CSS and double-check the meanings of words I’m about to write. And it does so much more.

I was playing around with the appearance and made a really minimal theme. There was a handy sharing feature so I thought I may as well share it…

[{{<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-2677" alt="Minimal Alfred v2 theme" src="/images/2013/03/alfred-theme.png" width="730" height="540"  caption="Minimal Alfred v2 theme">}}](http://an.lklink.at/NwQZ)

[Grab my Alfred v2 ‘Minimal’ theme](http://an.lklink.at/NwQZ). If you’ve got v2 installed on your machine, this link should auto-add the theme to your app. If you don’t, it won’t do anything!
