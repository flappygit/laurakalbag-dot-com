Next month I’m speaking and running a “creator unit” at border:none in Nuremberg. This is incredibly exciting as it’s an event focused around the decentralisation of the web, a topic that I care about a great deal. I’ll be talking about using considerate design and great user experiences to create genuine alternatives to the products that make money from exploiting their users’ data.

It’s also an all-new topic for me to share with other people, so I can’t wait! [Tickets for the whole 2-day event](https://border-none.net/2014/tickets) are just 199 euros, and they have a really clever way of matching participants up with the topics they’re interested in, using [an “aurora” of interests](https://border-none.net/2014/tickets#c67). You really should come along.
