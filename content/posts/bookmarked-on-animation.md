A few weeks ago I gave a workshop in New Zealand about designing inclusive content and accessible design. Afterwards, I was asked for recommended reading on accessible animation. These are a bunch of bookmarks I’ve stored up, and what I’d recommend to get started on designing and building animations in an inclusive way:
