Yesterday I gave a talk at the [fantastic online conference CSS Summit](http://environmentsforhumans.com/2013/css-summit/) on ‘Sass for designers’. It uses [my new site Web Talk Dog Walk](http://webtalkdogwalk.in/brighton/) as a case study, and explains the basics of Sass and how to get started using [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/).

Usually I wouldn’t recommend checking out my slides, as they’re useless without me explaining them, but as this was an online conference and I wanted the slides to be extra clear in case of technical problems, they hopefully read in a fairly easy-to-follow way:

[See the Sass for designers slides on my Conferences page](http://laurakalbag.wpengine.com/conferences/#post-3873).

I’ve also made [most of the site code (the stuff not covered by other people’s licenses!) available on GitHub](https://github.com/laurakalbag/webtalkdogwalk). I’ve tried to make the commits fit in with the slides as much as possible.

Edits: the very kind [Roy Tomeij](https://twitter.com/roy/status/360670152855011328) wrote a post about [when to use mixins vs @extend in Sass](http://roytomeij.com/2013/should-you-use-a-sass-mixin-or-extend.html) following my talk. I didn’t know much about @extend, but now I do! So [this is some additional recommended reading](http://roytomeij.com/2013/should-you-use-a-sass-mixin-or-extend.html).

Andy Spicer also asked if I could share my [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) mockups for the site design. [You can download the zipped .sketch file here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/13tfiy8xzworplz/Web%20talk%20dog%20walk%20mockup.zip). I use [the latest version of the Sketch beta](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/beta/), so you’ll need to use this to open the file as it may not be compatible with older versions.

		A good wee article Laura. Always interested in seeing other workflows. The more I read about Sass, the more powerful it gets. 

Until recently I didn’t know about placeholder selectors. Also, with RWD projects I’ve moved my breakpoint calls into a mixin and passing the breakpoint by a variable.

So many great tools out there at the moment :-)
