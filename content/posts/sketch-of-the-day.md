A strange thing has happened in the last week. I’ve been a bit blue, but I’ve really got into my [One Sketch A Day book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0811875342). This was a lovely little book that [Rachel Shillcock](https://twitter.com/missrachilli) sent me.

I started on the 12th December last year, with a quick sketch. I tried really hard and 9 days filled out with quick-ish sketches. The most detailed was the [Fringe-style seahorse](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=fringe%20seahorse&amp;tbs=imgo:1) I drew the day after we finished watching the [Fringe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_&#40;TV_series&#41;) finale. I love drawing in biro, it’s got an interesting texture and roughness that allows me to be a bit scrawly and messy in a way that a rollerball pen or pencil doesn’t. Most of my sketches were off the top of my head, without looking up reference images (the Fringe seahorse is an exception). Most of my [illustration work](http://laurakalbag.wpengine.com/types/illustration/) is digital, so it feels very un-work-like to create something where the final outcome is a one-off on paper.

I left the days I missed blank, and did a mediocre sketch every week or so. Now I’ve got a lot of empty pages.

This week I wanted to draw a bird. That’s not something I could draw off the top of my head, so I looked up a reference image that had the detail I wanted to use. Then I drew it in a fair amount of detail. This probably took about 15 minutes. And I was quite happy with the results, finally there was another sketch I was happy with sharing online.

[{{<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4234" alt="sketch of a chaffinch" src="/images/2014/01/screen_shot_2014-01-27_at_12.07.11.png" width="485" height="645"  caption="Sketch of the day #46">}}](/images/2014/01/screen_shot_2014-01-27_at_12.07.11.png)
And this got me on a nature theme, I drew a squirrel, a starling and a frog in the following days. This was so much fun, and a satisfying distraction from my gloominess. Each sketch took progressively longer, but I don’t mind because I’m enjoying the process, and I’m doing it for me.

I’m not sure how I feel about creating work from other people’s reference photos. It feels like cheating somehow. I took the photo of the frog myself, so I was happier with that. I’d assemble my own still life structures, like we did at school, but I don’t think I could find subject matter anywhere near as interesting as the nature shots I can find on the web!

This morning I’ve been the most ambitious so far. I cracked open a box of watercolour pencils I got given. I’m not great at handling watercolour, as most of my painting has been done in acrylic, but I think this will be fun to improve on.

I’ve no idea if I’ll manage to get to 365 sketches. I want to go back and fill in the empty slots too, so I’ve got lots of work to do. It’s not something I want to become a chore, but it’s a nice excuse to improve my old-school drawing skills.
