I’ve posted a [writeup of Build conference 2012 on ubelly](http://www.ubelly.com/2012/12/reinvention-and-building-ourselves-build-2012/).

Oddly, I’ve not found any other writeups from Build, which may be because (as I mention in my post) the talks weren’t those sound-bite talks that give quick take away tips. If anyone does come across any, please point me in the right direction as I’d love to see how other people approached the wide-ranging stories!
