My parents’ cat, called Milly. Who I call “Small Cat” because she’s so small.

[{{<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4684" src="/images/2015/05/DSCF4326-small.jpg" alt="Small grey and brown tabby/tortoiseshell cat lying on grass in the garden" width="1500" height="1000" caption="**Small Cat.** I edited out the wonky lamp in the background because it was distracting. I also muted the grass and plants so her scary green eyes would be more noticeable.">}}](/images/2015/05/DSCF4326-small.jpg)
