I don’t know if you know, but I made the website for the upcoming super exciting mobile conference, [The Big M](http://thebigm.mobi "The Big M website").

[{{< figure class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-326" title="The Big M website" src="/images/2011/03/full-site-589square-320x320.jpg" alt="The Big M website" width="320" height="320" >}}](http://thebigm.mobi)

As a result, I have 3 conference tickets worth £233.83 to give away to lovely people who want to learn more about mobile (covering topics such as innovation, usability, development, apps and mobile web.)

My 3 tickets are for the first day, the conference part of The Big M, which is on **21st March 2011** at Komedia in **Bath** (UK.) I’d love some friendly people to come along and keep me company (that’s not an obligation!)

## What do I have to do to get a ticket?

So, all you have to do to win a ticket is tweet something with the hashtag **#sendmetothebigm **or just leave me a comment below **before 12noon tomorrow** (3rd March.) I’ll pick three people at random after that and let you know via this blog page and via Twitter.

## What if I don’t get one?

There’s still some tickets left on [The Big M website](http://thebigm.mobi/#register "Tickets for The Big M"). With tickets as little as £199 +vat for a conference day pass and student conferences passes at just £50 +vat, you’d be mad to miss out on a fun new event in beautiful Bath.
