My digest post about New Adventures in Web Design conference –; [The Job, The Process and Creativity –; NAConf 2012](http://www.ubelly.com/2012/01/the-job-the-process-and-creativity-naconf-2012?WT.mc_id=evn-c-gb--dca-F3-naconf "The Job, The Process and Creativity - NAConf 2012") is now up on uBelly.

I’m now on board with uBelly to cover conferences and other webby stuff. This post is very much the same style as my previous digest posts, but on a different site.
