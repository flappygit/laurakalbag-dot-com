Yesterday I was a guest on [Tim Smith](http://twitter.com/ttimsmith)‘s [The East Wing podcast](http://theeastwing.net/). It was a pre-recorded conversation and it was great fun. You can [listen to it on the East Wing website](http://theeastwing.net/episodes/laura-kalbag), and it’ll be up on iTunes soon.

We discussed how I got started in the industry (really sorry traditional Graphic Design people, I may have generalised a bit…), speaking at conferences, women in the industry and mentoring.

As [I said last night on Twitter](https://twitter.com/laurakalbag/status/298862630506991616), Tim Smith is such a great guy. I really had my heart warmed and faith in humanity boosted by our conversation. His thoughts on women in the industry made me proud to be part of the web community.

And if you don’t already [subscribe to The East Wing podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-east-wing/id503801143?mt=2), do it! It’s full of great, and inspiring, insight on the people behind the work in the web industry.
