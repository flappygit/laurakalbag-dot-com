I’ve been thinking a lot about the design in ‘responsive’ design lately. [My post on 24ways](http://24ways.org/2012/design-systems/) is where I started to get some of my thoughts and ideas out. Here I talk about design systems and how thinking in this way, and basing our processes around this concept, can help us create more flexible future-proof responsive designs.
