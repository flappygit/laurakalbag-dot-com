Last Friday I was a [guest co-host on Unfinished Business](http://unfinished.bz/19) again. It was great fun, Andy and I spoke about clients, how location affects our businesses, how to find good subcontractors and Star Trek.

I’m a massive fan of Unfinished Business and listen to every episode so it was a real treat to go back again. Thank you for inviting me, Andy!

## Oh, and one more thing: Slide + Stage

One of the sponsors this week was [Slide + Stage](http://thelink.is/unfinishedbusiness), a full-day intensive masterclass with [Aral Balkan](http://aralbalkan.com). It’s going to be brilliant and I’m going to be there. I’ve already [written a post about how much I’ve learnt from Aral](http://laurakalbag.wpengine.com/learning-to-speak/ "Learning to speak"), and if you want to speak at events, or even just become better at presenting your work to clients, I really recommend you come along.
