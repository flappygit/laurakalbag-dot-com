Another photo post so soon? Yes! It’s the weekend, and Ashley gave us a really cool new exercise to try levitation, so I thought I had to try it.

[{{<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4680" src="/images/2015/05/DSCF4078-small.jpg" alt="A photo of me levitating in front of a window, with my arms and legs floating around." width="1500" height="1000" caption="**Levitation.** This took SO MANY tries. The light changed while I was setting up, so it was a bit tricky to edit the two originals together. I tried to crop out the most distracting elements of the shot, and desaturate the rest.">}}](/images/2015/05/DSCF4078-small.jpg)
