I walk my dog Oskar every day, no matter what the weather. And usually it’s just him and me. So I’ve got this idea. A “web talk dog walk” where a group of us from the Brighton area can meet on a regular basis (probably fortnightly, maybe monthly) to walk dogs and chat about the web. Do you want to join us?

## The first walk is 9am this Wednesday 12th June 2013

The best place to walk in the area (and conveniently [near to where we live is East Brighton Park/Sheepcote valley](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=203285113495597462862.0004deb99f76f41c37bbd&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=50.816724,-0.102396&amp;spn=0.00281,0.006968). Asides from at the very start of the route, it’s a long way to any roads so it’s safe to let the dogs off the lead. The easiest place to meet is on the [corner of Wilson Avenue and Roedean Road](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=203285113495597462862.0004deb99f76f41c37bbd&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=50.816724,-0.102396&amp;spn=0.00281,0.006968). I’ve planned out three of my favourite walks on the map to give you a rough idea of how far we tend to walk. Oskar is a big dog and I walk fairly quickly but we’re happy to do shorter slower walks depending on the company and the weather(!)

## Anyone can join us

* No need to bring a dog if you just want to walk and talk
* But please bring a dog or few if you’ve got them, walking with a pack will make it more fun!
* You don’t have to be a freelancer or professional or even work with the web, just happy to chat
* You don’t have to come every time, just whenever you fancy it
* Oskar gets along with all sizes and breeds, so please don’t be intimidated by his wolf-like appearance!
* We’ll leave pretty soon after 9am so please be on time or be willing to catch us up!
* You don’t need to let me know beforehand if you’re coming along, but I’ll know to wait for you if you send me a [tweet @laurakalbag](http://twitter.com/laurakalbag) beforehand
* Wear sensible walking shoes. Trainers should do. It’s a fairly mud-free route, but it can be rough terrain and a bit hilly

And now I wait and see if anyone can come along. If this day/time is inconvenient, then I’m happy to reschedule next time!
