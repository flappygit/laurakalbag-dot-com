Please excuse the wonkiness of my site. I am iterating on a new design, including all new backend. It’s static!

Because I apparently like to be stressed, I had a hard time limit for deploying this new design (today!) This means some of the content is a little garbled, and a lot of the CSS, particularly the colour schemes, needs refining in places.

For now I won’t be publicising this new design, so if you’re here and you’re seeing this, *shhh!*
