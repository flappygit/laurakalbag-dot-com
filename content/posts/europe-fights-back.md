[Last Friday’s Ind.ie roundup](https://ind.ie/blog/roundup-15-04-10/) had more on corporate surveillance, a couple of great videos with Edward Snowden, and Europe fighting back against Google and Facebook.

It took me a long time to pull it all together. I’m going to have to start writing my Friday roundups on Thursday! If you know of any interesting or relevant links, please [let me know](mailto:laura@ind.ie "Email Laura at Ind.ie") :)
