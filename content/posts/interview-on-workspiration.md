A few weeks ago [I answered some questions](http://workspiration.org/laura-kalbag) for [Workspiration](http://workspiration.org) on my hardware and software setup, inspiration and dreams.

Workspiration seems to have collected interviews from a huge variety of people working in and around tech, and with everybody answering the same questions, it makes for a really interesting read. Bonus is that they also (eventually) translate the interviews into Russian. It’s nice to see a site that’s open to non-English speakers!
