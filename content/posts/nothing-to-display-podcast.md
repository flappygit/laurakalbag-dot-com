Last week I had a lovely chat with El for her [Nothing To Display podcast](http://nothingtodisplay.co.uk/2013/03/02/nothing-to-display-podcast-no-3-the-web-freelance-life-mentoring-with-laura-kalbag/). We talked about technology and how people get started with technology, accessibility, mentoring and dystopian futures! It was a real treat.
