I’m speaking at the [WordPress London January meetup on the 17th of January 2013](http://www.meetup.com/London-WordPress/events/81910532/).

I’ve been using WordPress for years, for my own site and for client sites, and I really love it. I had absolutely no idea what to talk about though. I tend to create custom themes for clients, but these are very different from themes designed for use by many different sites, and so I wasn’t sure whether my experience would be relevant to many people. I also don’t feel very confident speaking about code.

## A mad idea

Thinking about the different things I do that are related to WordPress, I decided to go very niche. [WordPress admin icons](/project/wordpress-admin-icons/ "WordPress Admin Icons") are something I’ve been doing a lot of lately, and they combine the skills of icon design with the skills of fitting icons in with an existing set. My talk is going to be:

> ### Designing WordPress Admin Icons

> The WordPress admin has really evolved into something lovely over the last few years. So when you create plugins and custom post types, you want custom icons that feel at home in the interface. Laura is going to discuss her top tips for creating icons, and attempt to live-design a WordPress admin icon to show you step-by-step how she does it.

## Live-designing…eek

It might go all horribly wrong, but I thought the best way to describe how I design these icons isn’t just to show pictures, but to show the process. It’s often tricky to describe our processes as so many of the steps we do have become second-nature, we barely think about what we’re doing. So *hopefully*, designing live will help me do a better job of explaining the tools and techniques that I use.

### I’d love to see you there!

If you’re going to be there, do say hello! At the moment [it looks as though there’s no space left](http://www.meetup.com/London-WordPress/events/81910532/), but more spots will open up before the event.
