I’ve written up [my digest of Future Of Web Design 2012 over at the ubelly blog](http://www.ubelly.com/2012/05/craft-and-care-future-of-web-design-london-2012/).

For those who want more of a blow-by-blow account of the day, I’ve compiled all of my live tweets (and retweets) from the day in a Storify feed.
