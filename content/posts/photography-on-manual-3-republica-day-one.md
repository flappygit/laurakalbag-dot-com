This week, the Ind.ie team are at re:publica in Berlin, so I’m getting lots of opportunities to take photos that aren’t just of the dog!

I managed to get a blurry walking man against it all.">}}](/images/2015/05/DSCF3603-small.jpg)

I’m pleased I managed to get his face in focus, though it’s stronger around his mouth, whereas I guess the eyes is where we should be aiming for sharpness?">}}](/images/2015/05/DSCF3612-small.jpg)
