The last web talk dog walk was a success, with three of us (plus three dogs) taking in the slightly damp wilds of Sheepcote Valley. Now for the next one!

I was originally planning on making them fortnightly but have already failed as I wasn’t organised enough to sort one out this week. This means the next Web talk dog walk will be:

## 9am on Wednesday 3rd July 2013

Meeting at the same spot on the [corner of Wilson Avenue and Roedean Road](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=203285113495597462862.0004deb99f76f41c37bbd&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=50.816724,-0.102396&amp;spn=0.00281,0.006968) planning to walk for an hour or so (maybe slightly longer if I continue navigating badly) in [East Brighton Park/Sheepcote valley](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=203285113495597462862.0004deb99f76f41c37bbd&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=50.816724,-0.102396&amp;spn=0.00281,0.006968). I drew some routes on the map below, but I’m a terrible navigator so I can’t promise we’ll stick to them. Some lovely people have been clearing the paths in Sheepcote Valley so it shouldn’t be too much of a jungle exploration!

## Anyone can join us

* No need to bring a dog if you just want to walk and talk
* But please bring a dog or few if you’ve got them, walking with a pack makes it more fun!
* You don’t have to be a freelancer or professional or even work with the web, just happy to chat
* You don’t have to come every time, just whenever you fancy it
* We’ll leave pretty soon after 9am so please be on time or be willing to catch us up!
* You don’t need to let me know beforehand if you’re coming along, but I’ll know to wait for you if you send me a [tweet @laurakalbag](http://twitter.com/laurakalbag) beforehand
* Wear sensible walking shoes. Trainers should do. It’s a fairly mud-free route, but it can be rough terrain and a bit hilly
* Do I need to recommend you wear a jacket if the weather’s grey? Does it ever rain in Britain?
