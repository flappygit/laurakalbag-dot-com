		<p>Probably the coolest I’ve ever sounded…</p>

<p>Last week Ind.ie was featured in a Guardian article, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/01/punk-rock-internet-diy-rebels-working-replace-tech-giants-snoopers-charter">‘The punk rock internet – how DIY ​​rebels ​are working to ​replace the tech giants.’</a> We were interviewed by John Harris, and I think he did a really great job of explaining what we do and why we do it.</p>

<p>Not having massive experience in being interviewed, I was a little nervous that I’d sound a bit daft, especially as I’m nowhere near as eloquent as Aral. But overall, I think the quotes were good and it works as a primer that I’ll be sharing whenever somebody asks what we do at Ind.ie!</p>

<p>There’s a nice little paragraph where I sum up the why of it all…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I got into the web because I liked the democracy of it,” says Kalbag, who has just published a book titled Accessibility for Everyone, about innovating in a way that includes those who technology too often ignores – not least people with disabilities. “I want to be able to be in a society where I have control over my information, and other people do as well. Being a woman in technology, you can see how hideously unequal things are and how people building these systems don’t care about anyone other than themselves. I think we have to have technology that serves everybody – not just rich, straight, white guys.”</p>
</blockquote>

		Of course, Oskar had to be in the photos. Our faces was because I was really trying to get him to look at the photographer!
