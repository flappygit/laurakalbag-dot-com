	A weird experiment that almost works…
  **Sleeping in Spring.** Mucking about with overlaying a couple of photos. It’s a bit more editing than multiple exposures, but a similar style. I was just flicking through the layer blending modes and found something that looked a bit different. Here I’ve layered a couple of blending modes and erased some areas to bring Oskar’s face out <a href="/photography-on-manual-11-overlay/">Read Photography on manual: 11 –; Overlay</a>.

	The last few days have brought a very miscellaneous collection of photos.
  **Rama on the beach.** I was out trying to get the sea and the pier, but the weather was grim, and I found this little figure instead. I think it might be Rama, but I might be wrong…   
The next photo is part of our overlaying exercise set by Ashley. I did it in post-processing, before I discovered that my camera has a multiple exposure setting. <a href="/photography-on-manual-10-miscellaneous/">Read Photography on manual: 10 –; Miscellaneous</a>.

	This week we’ve been looking more at natural light, and portraits with foreground detail. I took my trusty (actually incredibly unreliable) model, Oskar, out for a walk and hounded him with the camera. It was a very grey day, but with a lot of light.
  **Oskar in the cow parsley.** It’s much easier to get a shot in focus when the model is sitting still! I’m pleased with the depth from the different layers of cow parsley. <a href="/photography-on-manual-9-oskar-in-the-grey/">Read Photography on manual: 9 –; Oskar in the grey</a>.

	Our most recent exercise was to take a long exposure shot.
  **Seafront traffic.** I wandered around for a while, trying to find a good angle from a height, but the traffic was too quiet! The main sea front road was much better, though it was pretty windy last night, so it’s slightly blurrier that I’d like on the static objects.   
Before that, Ashley gave us a great tutorial on using natural light. <a href="/photography-on-manual-8-traffic-and-jess/">Read Photography on manual: 8 –; Traffic and Jess</a>.

	My parents’ cat, called Milly. Who I call “Small Cat” because she’s so small.
  **Small Cat.** I edited out the wonky lamp in the background because it was distracting. I also muted the grass and plants so her scary green eyes would be more noticeable. <a href="/photography-on-manual-7-small-cat/">Read Photography on manual: 7 –; Small Cat</a>.

	When I started doing this course, I knew I’d probably end up with a lot of dog walking photos. Oskar and I are out every day, and so there’s lots of photo opportunities.
After exploring the self-timer in my last photo, I thought I’d try it again. Dog photos are obviously great, but I wanted something to show how we exist as a pair. Also outdoors.

	Another photo post so soon? Yes! It’s the weekend, and Ashley gave us a really cool new exercise to try levitation, so I thought I had to try it.
  **Levitation.** This took SO MANY tries. The light changed while I was setting up, so it was a bit tricky to edit the two originals together. I tried to crop out the most distracting elements of the shot, and desaturate the rest. <a href="/photography-on-manual-5-levitation/">Read Photography on manual: 5 –; Levitation</a>.

	On my last day in Berlin, I took a lot more photos. Last night I started post-processing them, following Ashley’s email and video tutorials. Post-processing is an area where I have more experience, I’ve done a lot of Photoshopping in the past, but now I’m trying to achieve new effects using Lightroom, which is a very different animal!
  **Me in a hotel room, original.** Travelling in Berlin, and being a bit slow to set up shots, I found my only (mostly) willing model was me. <a href="/photography-on-manual-4-post-processing/">Read Photography on manual: 4 –; Post-processing</a>.

  **Projection.** A very abstract photo.   
  **STG-1 (Stage 1) at re:publica.** A fairly dark location, lit very strongly at one end. I managed to get a blurry walking man against it all. <a href="/photography-on-manual-3-republica-day-one/">Read Photography on manual: 3 –; Day One at re:publica</a>.

	The first exercise we’ve been given is to capture a splash in a cup…
  **First splash.** My kitchen is in a basement, so it’s a little bit dark. Even with the ISO jacked all the way up, this was the lightest I could get with the fastest possible shutter speed.   
  **Second splash.** So I went outside! Unfortunately my burst caught the splash a bit late. <a href="/photography-splash/">Read Photography on manual: 2 –; Splash</a>.

	I’ve had a DSLR for nearly a year now. And I still only ever use it on the Auto modes. I studied photography (with film cameras) during my Art Foundation course ~10 years ago, but I think any decent photos were mostly luck, and I can’t remember much of it. So when Ashley set up her Girl With A Camera Course, “For the beginner photographer who wants to pick up their camera more,” I was instantly sold! <a href="/photography-on-manual-1/">Read Photography on manual: 1</a>.
