      <description>When I started doing this course, I knew I’d probably end up with a lot of dog walking photos. Oskar and I are out every day, and so there’s lots of photo opportunities.
After exploring the self-timer in my last photo, I thought I’d try it again. Dog photos are obviously great, but I wanted something to show how we exist as a pair. Also outdoors.

      <title>5 reasons why you should get an office dog</title>

      <description>Last week I wrote my Pastry Box thought on 5 reasons why you should get an office dog. It’s not just silly photos of Oskar, but actually five reasons why having Oskar for company has helped keep me sane. Through living and working by myself, to living and working with other people, he’s still incredibly valuable as a companion.
And if you do happen to like dog photos, you might want to follow @gigapup on Twitter or app.</description>

      <description>2012 has been a massive year for me. It was a year of saying yes to things that scared me. It was the first time I spoke at a conference (and I went on to speak at a further seven events.) I found the first house I’ve lived in by myself. I travelled to as many countries in one year as I had done in my whole life so far.</description>
