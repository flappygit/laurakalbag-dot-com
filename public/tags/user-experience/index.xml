&lt;p&gt;Every now and again someone will email me asking how they should go about learning design. After reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://aralbalkan.com/notes/design-is-not-veneer/&#34;&gt;Aral Balkan’s fantastic post&lt;/a&gt; on how design is not veneer, a few developers also expressed frustration at there not being many resources telling you how to get started with design. So I thought I’d post a few of my favourite links, books and ways of approaching design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, read &lt;a href=&#34;http://aralbalkan.com/notes/design-is-not-veneer/&#34;&gt;Aral’s post&lt;/a&gt;. It might seem intimidating. Aral emphasises the importance of considering every tiny design decision you make. There’s no easy-in. But really there’s no easy-in to doing anything well. Development might appear to be something with a low barrier to entry, but in order to do development with web standards, or to any level of efficiency, you need to take the time to learn the best techniques and working processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering every tiny design decision might also make design seem like a much more arduous process than it needs to be. In truth, if you are considering your users, their experience, and your overall design vision in the back of your mind, every decision you make whilst designing will be considered. It can feel somewhat subconscious at times. If you have the ‘feeling’ that your choice of typography suits the project, then chances are, if you analyse the cognitive and emotional impact on the user, you’ll find your subconscious actually made those decisions for a reason. Design isn’t instinct. This ‘instinct’ is really something that we’ve built up from the experience of millions of different design decisions, and evaluating their success and failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning-how-to-design&#34;&gt;Learning &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design is a pretty tricky thing to just ‘learn’; it doesn’t happen overnight. Following a tutorial on how to create a photo-realistic SLR camera in Photoshop is about as useful as following a tutorial on how to create an SLR camera in CSS; it teaches you how to use the tools but not about why you’d want to use an SLR camera illustration in your design. The best thing is to try as many different design tasks as possible to test yourself and gain experience on what does and doesn’t work. I also find looking at other people’s design work and considering its effectiveness really helps develop an understanding of design principles in relation to your own personal taste. This is what a lot of art and design education is built around; interpreting and understanding the work of other people. Blog posts where people tell you about their inspiration and how they designed their sites are the best sources for this kind of learning as you get real insight into the decisions of the designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opposite of this are sites that showcase trends, ‘beautiful’ websites or lists of a particular type of site as ‘inspiration.’ These tend to be examples of what are very aesthetically-pleasing designs, but not necessarily successful designs in terms of a good user experience. Of course convention can be a trend of sorts. If one designer establishes a really easy-to-use type of navigation, then it’s inevitable that those working on similar projects may use that standard as a basis for their own navigation, but only &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt; projects. It’s so easy to mimic a lovely visual aesthetic to make your project look good, but you really need to consider if that’s an &lt;em&gt;appropriate&lt;/em&gt; aesthetic style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;blogs&#34;&gt;Blogs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog-wise, I prefer the more ideasy and critical thinking blogs, as I find ‘how to design xyz’ is never terribly useful unless you’re working on an identical project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-list-apart-design-category-http-www-alistapart-com-topics-design&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alistapart.com/topics/design/&#34;&gt;A List Apart design category&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few magazine sites curate design content so well. It’s all too easy to fall into posts that are just lists of ‘inspiration.’ A List Apart is one of the most tightly-curated and edited magazines around, and their design articles are always worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;paul-robert-lloyd-http-www-paulrobertlloyd-com-journal&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paulrobertlloyd.com/journal/&#34;&gt;Paul Robert Lloyd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to learn more about design thinking, especially a focus on how responsiveness fits into design, Paul Robert Lloyd’s posts are must-reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;usabilitypost-http-www-usabilitypost-com&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usabilitypost.com/&#34;&gt;UsabilityPost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very insightful blog focused on usability, often discussing design in terms of successful user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;sidebar-io-http-sidebar-io&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://sidebar.io/&#34;&gt;Sidebar.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidebar.io is crowd-sourced by a select group, so has a slightly curated more zeitgeist-y feel to it. The links aren’t always long-form articles on design, but if there’s a good post going around, they’ll pick up on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;mark-boulton-http-www-markboulton-co-uk-journal&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal&#34;&gt;Mark Boulton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark has always been talking about more traditional design theory as a part of web design, and his approach has always inspired me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;people&#34;&gt;People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is a great way to keep up with good designers. I find these snippets of insight can often provide bite-size inspiration when I really need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;books&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m always disappointed that there aren’t more design theory books with a focus on web design. The few I’ve found are here, but also books on usability and graphic design where you can combine the knowledge to create a great design background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-practical-guide-to-designing-the-invisible-by-robert-mills-http-www-fivesimplesteps-com-products-a-practical-guide-to-designing-the-invisible&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/a-practical-guide-to-designing-the-invisible&#34;&gt;A Practical Guide to Designing the Invisible by Robert Mills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding design as a language, and how design is more than just the visual decoration. &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/a-practical-guide-to-designing-the-invisible/&#34; title=&#34;A Practical Guide to Designing the invisible&#34;&gt;I’ve reviewed Rob’s book in more depth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-practical-guide-to-designing-for-the-web-by-mark-boulton-http-www-fivesimplesteps-com-products-a-practical-guide-to-designing-for-the-web&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/a-practical-guide-to-designing-for-the-web&#34;&gt;A Practical Guide to Designing for the Web by Mark Boulton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great grounding in many of the different areas of design theory in relation to the web. I’m very eagerly awaiting Mark’s next book on grid theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;ordering-disorder-grid-principles-for-web-design-by-khoi-vinh-http-grids-subtraction-com&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://grids.subtraction.com/&#34;&gt;Ordering Disorder: Grid Principles for Web Design by Khoi Vinh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-dating responsive design, but still a very valuable book for learning about applying grids to web design in a practical way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-elements-of-user-experience-by-jesse-james-garrett-http-www-jjg-net-elements&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jjg.net/elements/&#34;&gt;The Elements of User Experience by Jesse James Garrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An oldie but a goodie. These founding principles really molded the way I view design for the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;designing-for-emotion-by-aarron-walter-http-www-abookapart-com-products-designing-for-emotion&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion&#34;&gt;Designing for Emotion by Aarron Walter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering not just the user experience, but the user emotions. A quick but brilliant read which &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/designing-for-emotion/&#34; title=&#34;Designing For Emotion&#34;&gt;I’ve reviewed in more depth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;edit-how-could-i-forget-this-first-time-round-elements-of-typographic-style-by-robert-bringhurst-http-www-amazon-co-uk-elements-typographic-style-robert-bringhurst-dp-0881792063&#34;&gt;[Edit: How could I forget this first time round?!] &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063&#34;&gt;Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An incredibly in-depth guide to typography, giving you all the basic principles you need and more.[/edit]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;edit-2-8faces-magazine-http-8faces-com&#34;&gt;[Edit 2:] &lt;a href=&#34;http://8faces.com/&#34;&gt;8faces Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not quite a book, but a beautiful typography magazine with new releases a few times a year. 8faces introduces you to great quality typefaces and provides plenty of insight into design with its feature interviews.[/edit]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-ll-try-to-keep-them-coming&#34;&gt;I’ll try to keep them coming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources on learning design aren’t necessarily those I keep a lookout for, but I’m going to make a conscious effort to do so from now on. I’ll &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/laurakalbag&#34;&gt;post on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and maybe do a round-up post later on, so let me know if you know of any good resources I should check out.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hi Laura, Love what you’re doing here. I myself am a college student and I created [Student Guide Web Design](http://www.studentguidewebdesign.com&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow) simply out of frustration with the material I was being presented during my design education. I love helping others because it’s a great way for me to learn myself, but also helps others out who are also trying to overcome the same challenges (because I was there at one point!).

Cheers from Canada :)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Last week I was at the wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;http://futureinsightslive.com&#34;&gt;Future Insights Live conference in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;. Annoyingly as I was speaking twice (that bit wasn’t annoying, it was fun!) I missed a load of talks, but had some fantastic discussions around some particularly interesting topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic of naïvety in user experience first came up in &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/aral&#34;&gt;Aral Balkan&lt;/a&gt;’s brilliant opening keynote, but using it as an approach it was an ongoing theme through the week, summed up by &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/globalmoxie&#34;&gt;Josh Clark&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/globalmoxie/status/197819148024283136&#34;&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;
Aral spoke about staying naïve in order to identify with a user who comes to your product afresh. It’s hard for somebody working on user experience to un-learn everything they know, but in order to create an experience that will be useful, and preferably enjoyable, for the user requires fresh eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking around this, I was considering another ongoing discussion that’s really been around for ages. Web vs. native, apps vs. sites. The evolution of the discussion in itself is definitely a blog post for sometime soon, but it was frequently the approaches of those involved in the conversation that made me consider the value of naïvety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m not claiming to be objective in the argument of web vs. native, I work with the web, and therein lies my natural bias. It’s very difficult as a creator to not favour the tool that you work with the most. Both web developers and native app developers are frequently guilty of considering each new project as a nail because they’ve got a web or native hammer that’s particularly comfortable to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As problem solvers, we need step back from our tools of choice, often also being what will make us money, and try to objectively decide what will solve the problem most effectively and efficiently. We need a naïvety that makes us untainted by our previous experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately we need to learn the separation between what are really standards and conventions that can assist the user in their learning process, and understanding our own experience that is clouding our judgment and making us expect the user to think in the same way that we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being open-minded is difficult, we’re constantly faced with our own experiences on which we can base grudges, evangelism and every possible opinion in between. But this discussion on web vs. native has made me think that, whilst experience can work in our favour, we must be careful that it doesn’t work against us. Next time we’re arguing for or against a platform/approach/ideology, we need to consider whether we’re using our experience to judge or if it’s just bias.&lt;/p&gt;

        It’s a great point. I had my eyes opened to a lot of great practices at Future Insights Live, and spent a lot of time thinking “that sounds awesome for project x”. On the other hand, also spent a lot of time thinking “hell, that’s another new thing I’ve got to learn”. I think therein lies some of the problem –; it’s a combination of comfort with the tools we already use, and an assessment of the learning time needed to learn a new tool.

Obviously in the long run having a wider skillset and more choices will benefit me, and my work. It’s sometimes difficult to take that long view on a day to day basis when there’s pressure to simply get things done, and less sympathy with the desire to take time to explore different options. 

Incidentally, really sorry I didn’t get to your talks at the event. I kept seeing tweets about how awesome your presentations were when I was sitting in different ones!

        Yet in the same way, we don’t want to become workers with generalist skills who don’t have time to know enough about anything in depth. It’s part of that T-shaped skills idea, and really knowing enough (and being honest enough!) to tell a client/boss that you’re not the right person, or don’t have the right tool, for the job.

(And no worries, the other talks looked great. There’ll always be the videos!)

        Great post! Can’t agree more with the above point.  Each project should be treated with an open-mind.  

At the end of the project, the designer / developer / consultant isn’t the end user in most cases and therefore the user should be put first.  Whether a project should be developed as an app, site or hybrid solution should be a decision taken on a project by project basis.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        My girlfriend says I’m dense.  But FILive taught me that I’m just a good designer.  The world is honestly pretty confusing once you start expecting good UX and design, and Aral’s talk made me feel OK about being genuinely confused by a lot of it.

      <title>Designing For Emotion</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/designing-for-emotion/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2011 09:43:18 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/designing-for-emotion/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I bought &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion&#34; title=&#34;Designing For Emotion by Aarron Walter&#34;&gt;Designing For Emotion&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion-mobile-first-bundle&#34; title=&#34;Buy Designing For Emotion and Mobile First together from A Book Apart&#34;&gt;A Book Apart deal&lt;/a&gt;, alongside Mobile First. After listening to &lt;a href=&#34;http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/58&#34; title=&#34;The Big Web Show #58&#34;&gt;Jeffery Zeldman talking about the release of these books with Dan Benjamin on The Big Web Show&lt;/a&gt;, and hearing how they were perfect books to read before a redesign (my site is in a constant state of awaiting redesign) I was really eager to get stuck in. Oddly, I decided to read Mobile First second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2011/11/20111115-090800.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center size-full&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2011/11/20111115-090800.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20111115-090800.jpg&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing For Emotion is the third book I’ve read in my read-a-chapter-a-day-for-inspiration series. I write this on a train journey after greedily guzzling the last three chapters in one go as I just couldn’t stop reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aarron Walter writes in an incredibly easy style. His warm, friendly tone helps enthuse you about emotional design and gives you so much to think about beyond the old basic idea that 404 pages should be cute and funny to make your users more forgiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, this book is a lighter read than previous A Book Apart books which is really down to its subject matter. You’re given a real overview of designing for emotion and deeper case studies into how it has been practically applied to different sites but, as Aarron points out in Chapter 4:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples…are not meant to be emulated, only to get you thinking about how you can convey your brand personality in your interfaces in a way that resonates with your audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that, if you’re anything like me, you spend the whole book studying the ideas and working out how you can use similar approaches in your own projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each chapter in Designing For Emotion takes you through a principle of emotional design:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional Design (Intro/Overview)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing For Humans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional Engagement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overcoming Obstacles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forgiveness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk &amp;amp; Reward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Forgiveness chapter is more specific than others, focusing on evoking a particular emotion, but the content comes across as equally important as those in other chapters as it is such a necessary emotion to consider on the web where errors and poor performance can easily tempt users to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I found this book insanely inspirational. Partly because it’s a subject rarely covered in such depth and with so much consideration, but also because it’s almost exciting in its enthusiasm, making it easy to read quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

        Great post. I am fan of the A Book Apart series, may give this one a read after Responsive Web Design.

      <title>dConstruct 2011 — My Digest</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/dconstruct-2011-my-digest/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2011 10:56:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/dconstruct-2011-my-digest/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;It was another inspiring day at dConstruct, the best abstract thought-inducing conference around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abstract nature of the conference is part of the appeal for most people. It’s hard to get enthusiastic about a talk that is teaching you more practical techniques, such as writing HTML, when you can so easily learn about it on the web in your own time. Conferences that inspire your passion for the industry, exploring other disciplines and encouraging you to approach your everyday work from a different angle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does mean that the talks at dConstruct weren’t a straight-forward formula of “here’s a problem, here’s the answer.” Most talks were more a commentary, or train of thought, more about trying to identify ideas and issues, working towards solutions, than the “perfect fix” for all our problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;digital-products&#34;&gt;Digital Products&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main theme of dConstruct this year was Designing Digital Products. For me, this seemed to be mostly covering digital products and our experiences with them, working on how to go beyond the usable (which is fortunately fast becoming the standard) to make these products *truly* personal, engaging and immersive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talks weren’t necessarily connected, but I found a lot of common threads throughout. This (slightly long!) post covers what I felt were the most prominent and meaningful themes. It’s &lt;strong&gt;about 15 minutes reading time&lt;/strong&gt;, I think I should warn you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#beyond-experiences&#34;&gt;Beyond experiences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-emotional&#34;&gt;The emotional&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#memories-and-augmented-reality&#34;&gt;Memories and augmented reality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#possessions-and-the-personal-empowering-users&#34;&gt;Possessions and the personal, empowering users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;beyond-experiences&#34;&gt;Beyond experiences&lt;/h2&gt;
In his opening talk, Don Norman spoke of how our products have evolved to be mostly about emotion and experience. Stephanie and Bryan Rieger expanded on that by discussing how we have to bear in mind that we are creating more than *just experiences *and that what we create now will define our future. On one hand, you may have no impact, but on the other hand you may have a huge impact and thus a huge responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delight became a big part of describing how to go beyond a usable experience. Don Norman used an example from the OSX interface. The way that Safari scrolling gathers momentum and bounces when you hit the top or the bottom of the window at speed isn’t about function and usefulness, it’s just about fun. It’s the details creating fun and elegance that make the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-emotional&#34;&gt;The emotional&lt;/h3&gt;
Kelly Goto gave a fantastic talk from her position as a researcher, explaining how understanding the users/consumers’ lives is so important when creating products. Kelly spoke of she tries to understand what’s behind when someone says ‘I love it’ and how understanding people’s rituals can help you understand their priorities and how their experiences are connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelly’s company does research through contextual interviews, also known as ‘deep hanging out’ where they spend time with people to understand how products make them feel and how it helps them complete their tasks. It’s all about the context of people’s experiences and how understanding a situation can give you a completely different connection to an experience. She explained how these observations are one of the most effective forms of research and acts as the opposite of relying on statistical research such as analytics (and to a degree, focus groups.) Analytics and focus groups as forms of research can lack context and have results skewed as what people say is rarely what they actually do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelly gave an example of a product that understands lifestyle; Withings’ scales aren’t ordinary scales, they tweet a user’s weight. This can help motivate the user and give them an experience that actually affects their life rather than just providing a utility service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Kelly ran out of time so she had to very briefly cover some interesting topics that I would have loved to have heard in more depth. She started to talk about Kansei engineering, and how it ties in with creating more emotion-based product experiences through mixing sensory aspects with a logical experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;memories-and-augmented-reality&#34;&gt;Memories and augmented reality&lt;/h3&gt;
Kelly Goto and Don Norman both spoke about making products addictive. Part of making products addictive, making the user want to return, is through making good memories of that product’s experience. Memories are actually more important than experiences because where experiences are brief, memories can last forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design memories not experiences. &lt;strong&gt;Don Norman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don Norman explained that the importance of memories is why we buy souvenirs and other memory-triggers such as photos, but the interesting part is that a memory isn’t necessarily true to reality. A memory can be like augmented reality, a skewed version of actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Slavin spoke about augmented reality and how it isn’t yet working as a genuine experience in the real world. Kevin’s main interest is in &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; we’re so desperate to create augmented reality and what it says about us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin explained how the working concept of augmented reality was created to assist workers in cabling to cable diagrams when working on Boeing planes. Having the cable diagrams mapped against the workers’ eyes allowed them to see where cables needed to be laid in real-space. This created the layer-like concept of augmented reality that we’re familiar with today in apps such as Layar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of layering replicant worlds to create augmented reality is that it makes the entire world feel less real and less immersive. It requires pointers in the augmented world to show users where to interact; this loses the magic compared to how everything is interactive in our real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin pointed out that this is because we are confusing replication, looking like the real world, with immersion. This is particularly a problem as we as a species tend to find complete replication unsettling, which seems to be the case with human-replica robots. We forget that it isn’t looking human that makes something feel human. The brilliant examples that Kevin gave to explain this point was the Muppets or Tamagotchis. The Muppets are puppets that mostly don’t look like humans, but it’s their actions and their human-like personalities that make them seem real. Tamagotchis are just a few pixels, but they became like real pets to children. It wasn’t through good graphics or looking like real creatures, but by the way their behaved real, through having needs, desires and vulnerability. These attributions gave Tamagotchis a deeper sense of being alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin summarised by saying that reality can be augmented, but not by adding a layer, and not through obsessing about optics. He likened augmented reality to porn, just a thin veneer of reality to fool the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;possessions-and-the-personal-empowering-users&#34;&gt;Possessions and the personal, empowering users&lt;/h3&gt;
Don Norman spoke about how digital products are changing to become more about co-creation and doing things yourself. This is changing the way products are made as people can easily make their own products as amateurs. The freedom of this technology and these platforms create infinite opportunities for creation, as well as giving people the power to do things for themselves that they couldn’t before. An example of this is blog platforms, where users can now publish for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelly Goto pointed out that customisation is a huge part of creating a good experience, being able to personalise what your possession does to express yourself. An example of this is in how huge the custom ringtone market is, where people strive to find the right ringtone to represent themselves or their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephanie and Bryan Rieger suggested that user customisation and creation also reduce the requirements for a polished product. You can create something ‘perfect’ for your users, but it will only ever be perfect for that average, homogenised user. Many users would prefer something non-linear and ragged around the edges that they can refine and make suitable for themselves. This lack of perfection also allows users to mold and create their own experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea of creating customised experiences has extended to whole services being based around the experiences of others’ products. Examples of these services are Readability and Instapaper, both apps making the reading of other people’s content a better experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Riegers described how Apple spend a lot of time controlling experiences where other platforms, such as blogs and Twitter, are giving more freedom to users to publish their own content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best designs will set the stage, but stop short of fully defining the experience. &lt;strong&gt;Adam Silver&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This breaking down of ownership has been enabled by the web. The Riegers explained how the web allows an idea to grow, almost organically or virus-like, independently from the original creator. Especially through open source projects, this transference of ownership can enable new voices and propel change (both positive and negative) beyond what could be achieved by the originator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a lovely and engaging talk by Matthew Sheret he spoke of totems. Totems are a concept recently brilliantly described through the film Inception, where a pocketable object you carry with you reminds you of the real world, reality and your home no matter where you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew went on to talk about how you can learn a lot about a person from their pocket possessions. They are intimate, meaningful objects who show off who you are, and this representation should be at the forefront of designers’ minds when creating products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the increasing importance of the personal, and its expression through possessions, Kelly Goto made a point that really made me think; we don’t really love our technological possessions (such as our phones) as an object, we love the experience they provide. We don’t love out phone if it’s broken, we can just move our experience, along with our data, to another device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew Sheret also spoke about this when he explained that the problem is that data-holding objects don’t have a huge life span, even though the data within it has the potential to live on. This means that there can be more meaning in the data than in the object, as throwaway consumer products aren’t the heirlooms they once were. They no longer have a chance to age or carry memories themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-value-of-systems&#34;&gt;The value of systems&lt;/h2&gt;
Don Norman discussed how there’s no longer a distinction between the internet at home/work and the internet in your pocket. You can move from one device to another seamlessly reading the same book or watching the same film. This means that design has become about learning how to create great &lt;em&gt;systems&lt;/em&gt; as they create great experiences across all of these devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephanie and Bryan Rieger explained how controlled environments don’t necessarily encourage growth. Proprietary systems, such as the pod-based coffee machines, use controlled factors which reduce a product’s ability to react to change. If there is a shortage of the materials to make the proprietary product, the whole system must change to accommodate a new material, whereas more flexible systems (such as the traditional French coffee press) are already created to work with different materials. This means that often the simplest and more flexible products are the most likely to succeed, withstanding the tests of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-diversity-of-systems&#34;&gt;The diversity of systems&lt;/h3&gt;
Craig Mod described how we tend to veer towards a small concentrated area of knowledge and often forget to have perspective. He emphasised the importance of working across disciplines, explaining that the further we travel from our specialist areas of experience, the better an idea we can gain of the frontiers and unknowns of our knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don Norman also spoke about how new inter-disciplinary skills are needed to cope with the crossover of products (apps/sites) that our systems cover as the systems themselves are more representative of the brand, and are more enduring, than the products and devices which carry these systems. The ease of a system will resonate beyond a fancy product. As the Riegers pointed out, our most valued systems are designed to live beyond the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don gave the example of this being why Apple are scrapping the standards and creating a new consistency across all their devices, making scrolling on OSX Lion consistent with gestural scrolling on iOS. It’s not about what we already understood as standard on OSX, it’s about establishing a new system that works across multiple products and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;narratives&#34;&gt;Narratives&lt;/h2&gt;
The one concept in experience that we don’t think much about is time. Time is what makes the experience of films, books and games successful. Don Norman believes that this is why educational systems will likely move into the gaming sphere, as it’s a way to make learning more immersive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan Hon’s talk was focused around storytelling on the web. Dan gave examples of the easy way and the complicated way to create stories on the web. The example of the complicated way was to create fictional alternate universes/futures with characters who have their own sites and profiles. The easy example was how people create parody accounts on social networks such as Twitter. Both can be a great source of entertainment but rely on the humour of the platform. For instance, Twitter is home to many parody accounts whereas Dan gave an example of how silliness and parodies aren’t welcome on Quora, and can be met with a dismissive lack of humour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platforms were key to Dan’s talk about storytelling. He pointed out that we don’t have specialist narrative-creation tools (or even for experiencing the narratives), and the platforms we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have aren’t ideal for story telling. There aren’t holodecks for holonovels as idealised in Star Trek, and there’s generally little room for free narrative discoveries. This is partly down to our platforms being so focused around ‘real’ people. Facebook and Google Plus make it near possible to create narratives as you’re only supposed to create accounts in your ‘real’ name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty in choosing platforms to create stories is that each platform varies in attention. Youtube has a fairly high chance of discovery as users tend to click from one related video to another, but there is a huge amount of videos to be found within. Other platforms have a very low amount of attention but more niche communities, heightening your chance of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kars Alfrink spoke about how game narratives could be used as test beds for societal situations, helping make a difference by creating simulations that encourage players to act responsively towards society. It did seem like a fairly radical approach and response to the UK riots, but Kars pointed out that it wasn’t just about rewarding positive behaviour, as incentivising and promoting rewards instead of rules isn’t the right way to encourage people to take moral responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kars spoke about how games, particularly folk games such as chess, can bring together cultures (although they can also create mono cultures) and how he believes that, through fitting games into our daily routines, they could have more value and affect more of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-speed-of-technology&#34;&gt;The speed of technology&lt;/h2&gt;
Kars Alfrink talked about how technology can amplify the speed and intensity of societal events. Stephanie and Bryan Rieger also spoke about how the rapid speed at which technology is developing, and is adopted, means that time is a luxury and striving for perfection can result in being left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically market penetration took a long time, allowing the creators of a product to establish models slowly, make mistakes and correct them, but now time is a luxury and products can become completely established or totally obsolete very quickly. This means there are no longer generations experiencing the same products, and no generation gap, as a few years makes an enormous difference in the products we use and our experiences of them. This has made users much harder to understand and control as well as meaning we must now be constantly creating new mental models for the way we create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephanie and Bryan Rieger explained that with the addition of portable devices, the distribution of ideas has been amplified in a storm of connectedness. Ideas very rapidly converge and create new ideas and events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-digital-past&#34;&gt;Our digital past&lt;/h2&gt;
Frank Chimero discussed how we’ve actually started to get to the point on the web where we have a history. In our personal digital histories we have huge silos of saved ‘Likes’ and ‘Favourites’. Frank gave the example that these collections that are reminiscent of the old-fashioned common place books, where people would copy their favourite text from other books into their own personal book. He pointed out that this was a type of curation, and that there’s a huge potential in our similar collections. The main value being in the collection as a whole, because of how the data can co-mingle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between our digital collections and the common place book is that in the digital world we can’t replicate that same architecture of serendipity. Where the common place book allows you to find the content as you browse, digital content allows you to search your content and it is brought to you. We miss this creative, curated style of browsing in our web experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite there not yet being any ideal web tools, collection and curation is changing the way we publish and consume as everyone can be a publisher and everyone can be a consumer. Don Norman pointed out that the trick now is discovering what is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; content. And that this can be accomplished through curation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank Chimero discussed how these differences between analogue and digital seem to define our ways to hold on to and remember the past. Digital is invisible, easy-to-forget and is rarely a physical presence but rather a phantom pile that is present but has no set parameters. There appears to be less value in the digital as you can give away copies many times whereas the analogue only has one copy that you can only give away once and thus embodies the associated history, memories and ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;caring-for-our-digital-history&#34;&gt;Caring for our digital history&lt;/h3&gt;
Frank spoke about unleashing the potential in our ‘Likes’, ‘Hearts’ and ‘Stars’ collections by curating, rather than just collecting. Using the curation second pass, we can create narratives, arranging our collections in more meaningful ways. Frank explained that there are restrictions in curating through the current tools/services we use to collect. It’s hard to discover patterns and &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; rather than just searching for what we’re looking for, and we limit the arrangement of our collections through blocky, spat-out layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating better curated collections would require better digital services. These services would need to change the defaults that we usually arrange our data by, using more personal and natural parameters such as those of LATCH as described by Richard Saul Wurman:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L&lt;/strong&gt; –; Location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; –; Arrangement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt; –; Time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; –; Category&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt; –; Hierarchy (or continuum, best-worst, first-last)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these parameters would be complemented by our adoption of a more contemporary museum arrangement to encourage more exploratory browsing. Frank described how creating more spacious layouts, where a user can enter and exit at any point could help replicate that more serendipitous experience of the common place book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;understanding-the-preservation-of-artefacts-and-not-just-data&#34;&gt;Understanding the preservation of artefacts and not just data&lt;/h3&gt;
Matthew Sheret spoke about how data and artefacts can complement each other in creating legacies. Attaching your totem personal possessions to RFID and similar trackers can create triggers for other services that can give you further connections. The example Matthew gave was using your Oyster London Transport card to associate locations with playlists you listen to whilst travelling. This can help you associate memories with places, giving meaning to your travel data, and allowing your totems to reflect your personal life back at you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even smart phones could be used as totems, as they go everywhere with you. As Matthew put it, these are the “prettiest sensors in the world.” Smart phones carry so much tracking information to help create more connective data describing your life. The more connections you create increases the value of the data and increases the value of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inverse can also apply. Matthew was using a hacked Doctor Who Sonic Screwdriver toy as a keynote remote. He suggested that hacking physical pocketable objects, such as toys, can create more useful objects that carry extra meaning through the function you have personally given to them. This can scratch the itch of the heirloom and potentially create the legacy personal possession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-summary&#34;&gt;In Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
dConstruct really emphasised for me that technology isn’t the detached work computer in an office for most of us. It is becoming such an integrated part of our lives that we no longer see it as alien objects that are invading our time and distracting us from our loved ones. The products that people are creating are helping us enrich our lives, understand ourselves and our environments better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that when making digital products, exploring the connection between the human and the machine is becoming more important. As we’re trying to improve on adequate, usable experiences, the focus is really shifting from the product and its functions over to the human and their behaviours, and how the technology works as an extension of human life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t a conference so much about ‘takeways’ but I took away a big sense of responsibility for the projects I work on. It’s pretty scary to think about the impact that you can potentially have on someone’s life through what you create, but massively thrilling at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;

        Holy cow. That is one hella long post. I’m going to have to ‘read later’ on this one.

Might be worth doing each talk as an individual post and releasing them daily over a week&amp;#8230; I would have been much more likely to read them all then. You could then link them all from a ‘master’ post :)

If you could  bits that you would recommend I read?

      <title>Insites Tour Brighton</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/insites-tour-brighton/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://insitestour.com/&#34;&gt;Insites&lt;/a&gt; is a mini tour of four cities in the UK where &lt;a href=&#34;http://keirwhitaker.com/&#34;&gt;Keir Whitaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://elliotjaystocks.com/&#34;&gt;Elliot Jay Stocks&lt;/a&gt; present discussions with well-known people from the web/tech industry. I was lucky enough to go to the first evening in Brighton on Monday where &lt;a href=&#34;http://aralbalkan.com/&#34;&gt;Aral Balkan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sazzy.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Sarah Parmenter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://adactio.com/&#34;&gt;Jeremy Keith&lt;/a&gt; were the guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-format&#34;&gt;The Format&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The format of the evening was something unfamiliar to most of us. Each guest was interviewed by either Keir or Elliot and then there were questions from the audience. Except it was much less formal than that. There were breaks in between and a comfortably small amount of people (I’m rubbish at estimating amounts of people so I’ll save you the pain) so there was a really relaxed and casual environment where everybody seemed happy to chat about anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genius was really in the way it was run. Keir and Elliot asked really interesting and leading questions and Aral, Sarah and Jeremy were all open and honest so they genuinely did provide insight into their lives in the web/tech industry. I don’t think it would have worked had the interviewers been unfamiliar with the guests, and with Keir and Elliot both working in the industry doing similar jobs to most people in the audience, their questions always felt appropriate and had something of the &lt;em&gt;that’s-just-what-I-wanted-to-ask&lt;/em&gt; about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-actual-insights&#34;&gt;The Actual Insights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;education&#34;&gt;Education&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that struck me about each of the guests (and a lot of people I spoke to) was that everybody was self-taught in some way. That’s really inspiring for anybody wanting to work with the web or iOS. Each of the guests hadn’t studied design or development formally yet they’re helping lead the way and set the standards in user experience, iOS design and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, despite not having formal education, Aral, Sarah and Jeremy each teach workshops. It goes to show how well they know their subject matter in order to host successful workshops, but also how the semi-formalisation of education can work and enough people seem to enjoy learning that way (rather than self-teaching through books or the web.) And a lot of people must prefer this way of learning as the amount of workshops seem to be on the up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;client-work&#34;&gt;Client Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the directions that a lot of web industry professionals seem to be taking lately is moving away from client work and towards making their own products. Aral was incredibly passionate about how much more he enjoyed working for himself in every sense, rather than having ever-changing clients for bosses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah provided some great advice on the warning signs when starting work with potential clients, as she’s had her fair share of painful client relationships, and relayed that she thinks she’s just* too* nice and so clients take advantage. As someone who completely identifies with the niceness approach, it was heartening to see that Sarah has found such great clients that she’s considering working for two exclusively. This is also interesting as it shows more of that same direction of moving away from working with different clients and towards maintaining products as a career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeremy was honest in saying he preferred to just get on with the development, and is very fortunate to work as part of an agency where Andy Budd enjoys handling the clients and accounts sides of a project. I think many freelancers find the sales and admin are the worst part of the job so it made sense that forming an agency with like-minded people would be a good idea, but Jeremy pointed out that this does only really work if there is one individual who is happy to work on the ‘business’ side whilst the others work on the project itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;outlooks&#34;&gt;Outlooks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I took away in summary to these talks was really one big point, &lt;strong&gt;everybody there was following a career path based around what makes them happy and fulfilled over what might make them rich&lt;/strong&gt;. And this really emphasises what I love so much about the industry. People are there because they enjoy it, people want to make a difference and make the web a really cool place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-the-rest&#34;&gt;And The Rest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the nature of the Insites tour, people came with a willingness to discuss work, process and dealing with clients rather than focusing on the techniques and technologies that we go on about during the working day. This lead to a few good discussions outside of the talks with the guests where I felt my brain buzzing from finally starting to understand a bit more about how we work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-am-endlessly-lucky-with-the-clients-i-have&#34;&gt;I am endlessly lucky with the clients I have&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assumed that most people had good clients. From the various discussions it does look like I am very lucky in having ended up with *predominantly* lovely, responsive, &lt;strong&gt;paying-on-time&lt;/strong&gt; clients. After talking to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mrqwest.co.uk/cc/&#34;&gt;Croydon Creatives&lt;/a&gt; bunch (and also something Sarah mentioned,) we really seemed to conclude that having a top contract is one of the most important aspects of client work. Not necessarily a boring law-speak contract, but something that appealed to the client and showed that you’re a human who deserves to be paid for your hard work, as well as laying out some &lt;em&gt;just-in-case&lt;/em&gt; terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;labels-and-titles&#34;&gt;Labels and Titles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the final fascinating conversation that was really ongoing throughout the evening outside of the talks was about labelling. It stemmed from Aral and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andybudd.com/&#34;&gt;Andy Budd&lt;/a&gt;‘s disagreement on what makes a UX Designer, but lead to discussing how we describe ourselves to clients and each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally learnt the different between ‘&lt;strong&gt;indie&lt;/strong&gt;‘ and ‘&lt;strong&gt;freelance&lt;/strong&gt;‘ (indie means you produce work for yourself or customers, freelance means you work for clients) and that Jeremy Keith works somewhere between a rotating job title and none whatsoever because it’s the work that do that speaks for you, rather than what you call yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion that I came to was that labels are a pain. Everybody is judged on what they call themselves and, within the industry, it doesn’t really matter as soon as you’re familiar with somebody’s work. What we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need labels and job titles for is accurately communicating what we do to potential clients. This means we should forget about the acronyms and jargon and sometimes the most appropriate description is ‘&lt;strong&gt;I make websites&lt;/strong&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-if-you-re-in-manchester-or-bristol-this-week-go&#34;&gt;So if you’re in Manchester or Bristol this week, go!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a day to write this post, so I’m a bit late in telling people to go to the London leg of the Insites tour, but Manchester is tonight and Bristol is tomorrow night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was definitely one of the best events I’ve attended in a while, and one that just gave me faith in how the industry and community is &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;brilliant&lt;/strong&gt; (and probably the best ever.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: please forgive my enthusiasm in this post, I hope it’s not &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; annoying, but I had a really good time!&lt;/p&gt;

        I couldn’t agree more with your thoughts on labels &amp;amp; titles, I think the same applies to CV’s (in the creative industries at least).  A list of academic achievements or awesome companies you’ve worked at doesn’t matter to me, it’s all about the quality of work *you* produce and the way in which you can articulate your ideas. 

The merits from working with great people &amp;amp; big brands definitely go some way to helping with that, but it’s not everything.

Great post, thanks for sharing –; sounds like a great evening! I’ll write the London night up when I get a chance to breathe :)
    &lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Notes from Ampersand conference — My Digest</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/digest-from-ampersand-conf/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2011 09:26:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/digest-from-ampersand-conf/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to condense &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/notes-from-ampersand-conf/&#34;&gt;my notes from Ampersand conference&lt;/a&gt; into a more useful digest. More than anything this, like my live-tweeting at past conferences, is really a selfish activity to help me absorb the ideas from Ampersand better by reflecting on the themes of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course in the spirit of the web and all things good, I may as well share this digest so anyone who wasn’t there might get a taste of the event (albeit through my probably-twisted interpretation and slightly dodgy writing!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-typography&#34;&gt;Using typography&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;typography-is-about-context-context-is-about-content&#34;&gt;Typography is about context, context is about content&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web ‘industry’ is starting to focus more on content strategy, and that the whole reason our sites are there is generally to showcase content, and this was reflected in the &lt;em&gt;importance of content&lt;/em&gt; being continually brought up throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vincent Connare was the first speaker of the conference. As the creator of Comic Sans, Vincent was the perfect person to explain the significance of fonts being created for a purpose, for a specific context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comic Sans was created for Microsoft Home software, when computers were starting to become used in the home. Its fun, casual, comic-book style was based on comics like Watchmen and Batman Returns and was successfully used in speech bubbles and children’s software. It’s the prolific abuse of Comic Sans in inappropriate signage, documents, and many other places that has made it so well-known and unpopular (&lt;em&gt;or inappropriately popular!&lt;/em&gt;) As Jason Santa Maria said when talking about choosing an appropriate typeface:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No type is born evil, it’s the context that dictates if it works.

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon Tan and Jonathan Hoefler both spoke about Bell Centennial, a font designed by Matthew Carter for phone books. The considerations in creating this font included environmental awareness, such as how the font is used and where it’s used. Matthew Carter made Bell Centennial easy to skim-read at 6pt and used ink traps for where the ink was likely to bleed on the texture of the phone book paper making the small text even harder to read.

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;#### Content first&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Brown and Jason Santa Maria both spoke about how the context of the content gives them meaning when choosing a suitable font and how vital it is to compose your design with accountability. Some points they focused on for selecting a suitable typeface were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The content&lt;/strong&gt;, its message, its reason for being&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The audience&lt;/strong&gt;, who will read it? and how? for how long?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The culture&lt;/strong&gt;, the historical and cultural significance of the content, whether it will be read in other languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The context of the typeface itself&lt;/strong&gt;, its resumé, what it signifies to others, how its production affects its appearance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;content-out&#34;&gt;Content-out&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Boulton got us designers thinking around content in a new way which is less concentrated on the limitations of our canvas (the size of the browser, the device) and discussed possible solutions for designing from the content-outwards. Mark suggested that as designers became fixated on web standards, we started to take the separation of content and style too literally which meant we created meaningless designs separated from our content. The content-out route really involves knowing the content first, which prompted a brilliant quote from Mark:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know your content or audience, go to the pub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admitting he didn’t yet know any solid solutions, but wanted to encourage discourse, Mark suggested processes such as working on the details first then assembling a modular design from the details. This process is one that complements the &lt;strong&gt;responsive web design&lt;/strong&gt; approach which almost every speaker hailed as a new way of working on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;responsive-design&#34;&gt;Responsive design&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon Tan explained how typography is one of the elements we can keep consistent across responsive design that reconfigures itself to suit different scenarios. No matter what the layout, screen size or device, the typography (along with colour) can instantly identify a design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Brown explained his process for building responsive design systems around type. The web, with its inherent flexibility, resists the rigid traditional print frameworks using ratios and fixed grids that previously gave designers a structure to work within. Tim suggests creating a modular scale, with the layout and every other element following the type, allowing it to work consistently regardless of device. This is based on the principle that we need a constant to work from in our designs, and type is a perfect constant to use. This is a way of thinking that designers can easily practise and exercise without affecting any of our current processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim went on to describe how using a &lt;em&gt;modular&lt;/em&gt; scale, rather than arbitrary numbers, we can create a design system that is visibly cleaner and more harmonious. He suggested choosing sizes and spaces, such as type, borders, margins, padding, based on a pattern or scale. A couple of examples of ratios that Tim provided were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;golden ration 1 : 1.618&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;musical fifth 1 : 1.5
&lt;a href=&#34;http://modularscale.com&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-467&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-22-at-09.15.55.png&#34; alt=&#34;A modular scale created using Tim&amp;#39;s website modularscale.com&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		A golden ratio modular scale created using Tim’s website modularscale.com
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different ratios traditionally have meaning or significance to different types of people, so these contexts can even be used to choose an *appropriate *scale. This also gives designers a reason and justification to backup our design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;typography-is-more-than-text&#34;&gt;Typography is more than text&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason Santa Maria talked about how typography has a dual life. It’s about both the &lt;strong&gt;aesthetic&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;readability&lt;/strong&gt;. As designers we can often get caught up in how the text looks as a whole, but in reality users see the whole as texture and they skim across it. Users are more likely to stop and fixate on a small area for a moment, and this is where they will notice the typography and if it makes the text difficult to read. Jason emphasised the well-known idea that &lt;strong&gt;good typography is invisible&lt;/strong&gt;, it’s about not making the user think or struggle to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason also made the point that readability isn’t always *can I read it? *but also *do I want to read it? *It’s in these scenarios that good typography can help create emotional experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;typography-can-create-emotional-experiences&#34;&gt;Typography can create emotional experiences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon Tan really expanded on his &lt;em&gt;New Adventures in Web Design&lt;/em&gt; talk about the lizard brain by emphasising how typography can influence the subconscious. A typeface can convey emotion beyond the words in the text. Jon Tan quoted Paul Rand saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A logo derives meaning from the quality of the thing it symbolizes [&amp;#8230;] what it represents is more important than what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is controlled by a part of our brain called the amygdala which can evoke emotional responses without verbal or linguistic input. Jon explained how this means as designers, we need to understand how the brain works, how we need to understand how design makes us &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vincent Connare made an interesting point when speaking about the design of Tahoma as a replacement for MS Sans. Tahoma was designed by Matthew Carter who is a real type designer and he created a technically superior font compared to MS Sans which was created by an engineer. Still, many users complained that they preferred MS Sans. As people get an emotional attachment and loyalty to that which they know, MS Sans was generally considered the ‘better’ font even though it was technically inferior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;typography-is-hard&#34;&gt;Typography is hard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who often feels that typography can be overwhelming, and that it’s very difficult to know when you’re making the right decisions, it was great to hear Jason Santa Maria say that &lt;strong&gt;typography is hard&lt;/strong&gt;. Jason went on to explain that a designer doesn’t need to know *absolutely everything *about typography to use it well, you just need to know how to estimate a font.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;guidelines-for-choosing-and-using-type&#34;&gt;Guidelines for choosing and using type&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason went into great depth on how to choose typefaces. He explained that there are no rules in typography, its imperfect precision where you can only be guided by basic principles and understanding the constraints. Some of the top tips that Jason gave were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose workhorse typefaces&lt;/strong&gt;. We shouldn’t feel obliged to choose a new typeface for every project. Create a personal palette of typeface families that work well in display as well as body text. Use different styles from the same family to save having to find multiple typefaces that work well together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid overly themed typefaces&lt;/strong&gt;. These ready-mades show a lack of imagination. Subtle fonts can promote different emotions more effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a list of attributes and feelings that you want to convey, then find typefaces that convey that feeling&lt;/strong&gt;. This also works for looking for typefaces that are similar, but not the same, to a standard that you use (perhaps such as Helvetica or Georgia.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Test your fonts in context **and in the right space. Choose your font appropriately to the line height, line length and size required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;web-fonts&#34;&gt;Web Fonts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-benefits-of-web-fonts&#34;&gt;The Benefits of Web Fonts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone at Ampersand was evangelising web fonts. It’s impossible to not do so with all the exciting possibilities playing with lovely new fonts can bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon Tan described it as a time of &lt;strong&gt;renaissance&lt;/strong&gt; considering we were previously forced to use such a minimal font palette, and we’re now being given a chance to prove our skills in design using these new tools. We can now choose type that’s *perfect *for purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason Santa Maria echoed what I think everybody else was feeling in that it’s a good time to be a designer. Jason shot down the cynical idea that pople are misusing or abusing fonts and emphasised the benefits that we’re gaining in accessibility through no longer having to provide non-standard fonts through dodgy font replacement techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon and Jason both spoke about how type can define a brand and how web fonts are helping unify the identity of brands across print and the web, helping convey a voice, facilitate an emotion, and create a relationship between the user and the design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-downside-of-web-fonts&#34;&gt;The Downside of Web Fonts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the eagerness to try new web fonts, there was a lot of talk of the downside of web fonts, but with a positive outlook on how the awkward issues can be solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-back-at-font-engineering&#34;&gt;Looking back at font engineering&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;metal-typesetting-bitmap-font-creation-and-os-safe-fonts&#34;&gt;Metal typesetting, bitmap font creation and OS-safe fonts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Berlow harked back to working in font engineering when fonts were first needed to look consistent from computer software to printer, explaining how this relates to the web fonts emerging today. One of David’s main considerations is how poor fonts can look at very small sizes. Bearing his experience with metal case type and bitmap fonts in mind, David focuses on how to make web fonts easier to read including basing them on specific size grids, using large x-heights with generally large amounts of whitespace and simplifying fiddly and complicated details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rendering&#34;&gt;Rendering&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rendering is a big issue, mentioned by most of the speakers. Jonathan Hoefler spoke about how the type designers at Hoefler and Frere-Jones are creating insane amounts of newly hinted glyphs in order to make their web fonts work as well as they possibly can across the web. Many web fonts are just bad translations of fonts created for print and consequently barely work on the web. A few speakers discussed the difficulties in the differences in fonts across Windows and OSX, with some users preferring Windows’ ‘*crispness*‘ and others preferring Apple’s ‘*soft detail*‘.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Brown emphasised how important it is to check your web font choices live, and repeating these checks across the different environments that will use those fonts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Daggett described the issues created by web browsers choosing their own fallbacks, such as creating awful synthesised bold fonts through smearing or drawing the letters twice, or obliqueing fonts to give them an italic appearance. Jonathan Hoefler expressed how the lack of being able to distinguish unusual font styles can be an issue, especially for those that have a back slant or are number-only fonts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;css-working-draft-for-fonts&#34;&gt;CSS Working Draft for Fonts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Daggett’s talk was an intense look at the potential future of web fonts being controlled through CSS. It was at this point that I felt particularly hopeful. There’s something amazing about how quickly the web seems to have gone from a miserable collection of ‘web-safe’ fonts to being able to see how we can potentially use alternate glyphs and handle kerning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think my notes cover all the fantastic features that John described, so for those I recommend you see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/&#34;&gt;CSS Working Draft for Fonts&lt;/a&gt;, but here are some of the exciting tidbits I fancy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using opentype font features through ‘font-variant:’&lt;/strong&gt;. This means having loads of different font features such as multiple glyphs per character in an easy-to-use package giving us fine-grain control all through CSS. At the moment &lt;em&gt;font-variant&lt;/em&gt; is used predominantly to select small-caps (with limited success.) The potential in &lt;em&gt;font-variant&lt;/em&gt; means we could eventually select font features such as petite caps and automatic fractions, have more control over fallbacks, kerning, ligatures, language support and numerals, as well as supplementing other CSS properties such as &lt;em&gt;text-transform&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security for web fonts&lt;/strong&gt;. Rather than DRM, the idea is to restrict the origin of the font through http headers and the like, requiring a particular protocol, site or port. This could prevent other sites hot-linking your fonts or sniffing your font URLs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-day-listening-to-clever-people-talk-about-fonts&#34;&gt;A day listening to clever people talk about fonts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that me bothering to write a massive blog post about the themes of Ampersand conference really shows what an amazing day it was. I felt completely inspired, enthused and almost exhausted by the ideas and feelings being expressed by the speakers. I hope this rather disjointed digest might have helped bring some of this excitement to you lot who couldn’t be there on the day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conferences-are-my-social-life&#34;&gt;Conferences are my social life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I go to more conferences, I meet more lovely people and get to see friends I’d only ever talk to on Twitter otherwise. In the last two years, I’ve been to about three a year and it feels about the right amount that you rarely see the same talk twice and it’s not just the same topics going round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I met loads of great people at New Adventures, but unfortunately missed more people than I meant to catch up with. It was such a packed-out venue that it was easy to lose people in the crowds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-location-and-venue&#34;&gt;The location and venue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take too long to get to Nottingham from Surrey. We were lucky that the motorways were reasonably clear and we spent most of our time trying to navigate Nottingham’s one way systems when we got there! It was good to go to a conference outside London but the resulting hotel and petrol costs for me (I can commute to London easily) made it almost as expensive as attending more expensive conferences in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The venue, Albert Hall, looked beautiful and made it easy to hear and see the speakers wherever you were sat. For me, the downside to the venue was that I was really cold for most of the day. I know I feel the cold more than most, but it was a bit uncomfortable sitting there in a scarf and gloves. Often conferences are warm environments due to the amount of people in one room so I admit I was probably under-prepared for the wintry day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-talks&#34;&gt;The talks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;twitter&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn’t any wi-fi at the conference, which was great because there were less faces hidden behind laptops (it’s really distracting when you’re sitting behind someone writing code!) However, this did mean there was less back channel discussion on Twitter, it was mostly people quoting favourite quotes. It was a bit of a shame as I like the back channel. It gives people the confidence to bring up issues and questions that they wouldn’t necessary ask the speakers in front of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made use of the 3G signal on my phone to make notes on Twitter about the conference, it’s the way I learn and helps me digest ideas (I’m a complete fidget.) I know I’m likely to irritate people by doing it, but a few said they liked to hear some of what was going on so I think it’s much more worthwhile than keeping it to myself. These notes, along with the great tweets from the brilliant &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/ubelly&#34; title=&#34;ubelly on Twitter&#34;&gt;@ubelly&lt;/a&gt;, helped me form some connections between the ideas and help me understand them better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;You might want to click the image to see it larger so you can read the really dinky text.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/dconstruct-2010/&#34; title=&#34;dConstruct 2010&#34;&gt;my notes on dConstruct&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to connect the different themes running through the talks as they made the day so much more than just random talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;running-themes&#34;&gt;Running themes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many of the talks felt as though they were revolving around connected themes. This made the day feel as though you were getting different sides of the story which suited the half hour slots which might have otherwise felt brief. Particular themes such as user experiences, emotional design, narratives and content-aware design made me feel very grown up. Much like dConstruct, it seems like the conference circuit is moving on from the slightly patronising show-and-tell and instructional talks to more inspiring, motivating and thoughtful discussions on how we can be better and make the industry move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-favourite-talk-the-new-language-of-web-design&#34;&gt;My favourite talk: The New Language of Web Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d say my favourite talk (though I enjoyed them all) of the day was &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/danrubin&#34; title=&#34;Dan Rubin on Twitter&#34;&gt;Dan Rubin&lt;/a&gt;‘s. The topics of language, communication and terms in the industry felt just right for the audience and the maturity of the conference. Dan is a consistently fantastic speaker and his was the one talk that really stood out as being the perfect amount of exploration into the subjects for the half hour slot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-ll-be-looking-out-for-new-adventures-next-year-8230&#34;&gt;I’ll be looking out for New Adventures next year&amp;#8230;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing can be sure, &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/colly&#34; title=&#34;Simon Collison on Twitter&#34;&gt;Simon Collison&lt;/a&gt; put on a great conference. There was a really friendly, we’re-all-in-it-together, casual atmosphere that was fun and in no way intimidating to new conference goers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a lot of the bigger conferences are becoming more expensive with little added value, less expensive conferences like New Adventures are in competition to provide a great time at a freelancer’s price tag. It definitely achieved that, feeling like a premium conference on a very affordable budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s a New Adventures next year, I’ll definitely try to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autodesk SketchBook Pro</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been a kind-of arty person. I took Art at school, did an Art Foundation and a Graphics degree. I totally loved art when I was small, but as I’ve got older, and more technology and web-obsessed, a lot of the old media went a bit out of the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I was still loving wireframing and taking notes by hand, I just threw all the paints out in frustration at how slow and difficult they were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d seen the iPad apps available before launch, and Autodesk’s SketchBook Pro caught my eye. The idea of drawing on-screen is pretty appealing (I never really got the hang of the chunkiness of the Wacom tablet) and SketchBook Pro is better than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my most recent drawing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/06/photo.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-41&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/06/photo-960x720.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;drawing of a fish using SketchBook Pro&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sitting at the fishing lake at Longleat, sketching from a photo in Matt’s fishing magazine whilst he fishes. (And using the WordPress app for writing this, but that’s a story for another time.) Asides from the sunlight making it a bit tricky to see anything other than my greasy fingerprints, it felt incredibly natural painting with my finger. Some clever person has probably come up with a way of using a stylus but I think that might spoil some of the charm. Finger painting is a bit thick, blobby and impressionist. I’m actually surprised by how much this looks like if I’d painted it in acrylics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SketchBook Pro uses gestures as naturally as any native iPad app. You use 3-finger tap to open the tools, 2-finger pinch and drag for resizing and moving the canvas on the screen (so you can zoom for the fiddly bits) and a 3-finger left-to-right drag to undo your last marks (and right-to-left for redo.) I’m usually a bit rubbish at remembering all these kind of gestures but they just &lt;em&gt;feel so right&lt;/em&gt; that it’s easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capabilities of the tools are just amazing for an iPad app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-brushes-palette&#34;&gt;The Brushes palette&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/06/photo_4.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-42&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/06/photo_4-960x720.png&#34; alt=&#34;the brushes palette in SketchBook Pro&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;The amount of elements you can combine to create your own style and perfect the texture and colour you want are just incredible. I’ve not even tried everything yet, but some of my favourite elements are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radius—for going from the rough fat splodges to the tiniest little pixels, this gives you very fine-tuned control though it can be tricky to accurately choose the right radius with the small slider (despite my little fingers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opacity—opacity of your brush. I reckon it’s best used at less than 100% to give a more realistic painting effect, the more solid your brush, the more it’ll look like an old-school MS Paint picture!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type of brush—I’ve been sticking with this fine paintbrush style for now. It’s a very predictable, softish round brush.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colour palette—colour selection that beats Photoshop. It’d be great to have an interface this good for Photoshop. You can be so specific in your colour choices and easily change by Hue, Saturation or Tone which is great if you’re creating gentle gradations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-incredible-layers-feature&#34;&gt;The incredible Layers feature&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can only have five layers, but you can merge your layers together when you’ve used all five to give you more control over editing work on a new layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my fish picture, I started with some basic line-drawing and blocking out colour. Then on a layer above, I gave it a wash of light yellow with a big fat, mostly transparent, brush and set that layer to 50%. This made that wash more subtle, then I merged the layer down (I knew I wouldn’t need to finely edit this rough stuff later) to make my basic base layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/06/photo_3.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-44&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/06/photo_3-960x720.png&#34; alt=&#34;lowest layer of blocked colour&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next layer I used to add some more fiddly detail and shadow. I kept this separate from the layer below for if I wanted to go back and erase parts without wiping my base layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/06/photo2.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-45&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/06/photo2-960x720.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;middle layer on my fish picture&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;Then over the top, I tried to make the detail a bit more subtle and give the fish a slightly more realistic 3D multi-coloured appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/06/photo1.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-43&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/06/photo1-960x720.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;layers in SketchBook Pro&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty pleased with the overall effect and I’ll definitely keep trying to practice drawing and sketching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other features of SketchBook Pro as well! My sister liked the mirrored setting and another friend made a great landscape using textured brushes for plants and flowers. I’ll also be looking out for further Autodesk apps as they seem to have the iPad interface totally nailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you fancy getting a bit creative on the iPad, &lt;a href=&#34;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sketchbook-pro/id364253478?mt=8&#34; title=&#34;SketchBook Pro on iTunes&#34;&gt;go download SketchBook Pro from the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. At £4.99 it’s a steal. The amount of thought and skill gone into the user experience of the app makes it worth far more, and undoubtably more than many higher-priced apps.&lt;/p&gt;

        Wow –; I am always in awe of people that can produce pictures that look both detailed and pleasing. It’s a real gift. And to produce something that looks so like a drawing on a screen if amazing, you are so talented. I know a lot of artists shrug off what they do, but to a non-artist, this sort of thing seems like a mystical magic.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        What a lovely tutorial, i stumbled over this looking for help with fonts but i’m so glad I did.  Very well written and illustrated.  I also am an artist and recently got an iPad and you have inspired me so thank you.  I need to get back into my art and you have given me that push :)
    &lt;/div&gt;
