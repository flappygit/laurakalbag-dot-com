      <description>A few months ago Tyler Sanguinette sent me some questions about design and web typography as part of his thesis on web fonts.
Recently I found that he’d published the interview, and interviews with a load of very smart people, on the Type Quest website. Type Quest also has some really useful information on the OpenType features of web fonts, so it’s well-worth a look.

      <description>I’ve written a big old writeup for ubelly from my notes at Ampersand conference earlier in the month.
This was an event I decided not to live-tweet, as the content is usually more involved and in-depth, making for a better big writeup and less tweetable quotes.
