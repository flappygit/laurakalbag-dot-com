	I’ve written a post over on The Branch.
 James Dinsdale emailed me about a new project he was starting out, called The Branch, a site collecting posts about what inspires people. I love these kinds of posts, so I was really keen to be involved.
As a designer, inspiration is a much-discussed topic. Unfortunately, this ‘inspiration’ is often described as particular styles of design and the work of individual designers. <a href="/the-sharers-on-the-branch/">Read The Sharers on The Branch</a>.

	Every now and again someone will email me asking how they should go about learning design. After reading Aral Balkan’s fantastic post on how design is not veneer, a few developers also expressed frustration at there not being many resources telling you how to get started with design. So I thought I’d post a few of my favourite links, books and ways of approaching design.
First off, read Aral’s post. <a href="/learning-design/">Read Learning Design</a>.

	Funnily enough, a couple of days before Mark Boulton said to critique design effectively.&quot; says Mark Boulton on Twitter&rdquo;) and wrote his piece on design critiques, I’d been thinking about that same topic. I’ve been struggling through an iPhone app icon design, and had asked Twitter for help. I&rsquo;ve got an app icon design that needs some criticism as I&rsquo;ve lost sight of it. Anyone free to give me some time via email today? <a href="/critiques-giving-and-receiving-useful-feedback/">Read Critiques, giving and receiving useful feedback</a>.

	Insites is a mini tour of four cities in the UK where Keir Whitaker and Elliot Jay Stocks present discussions with well-known people from the web/tech industry. I was lucky enough to go to the first evening in Brighton on Monday where Aral Balkan, Sarah Parmenter and Jeremy Keith were the guests.
The Format The format of the evening was something unfamiliar to most of us. Each guest was interviewed by either Keir or Elliot and then there were questions from the audience. <a href="/insites-tour-brighton/">Read Insites Tour Brighton</a>.

	Conferences are my social life As I go to more conferences, I meet more lovely people and get to see friends I’d only ever talk to on Twitter otherwise. In the last two years, I’ve been to about three a year and it feels about the right amount that you rarely see the same talk twice and it’s not just the same topics going round.
Again, I met loads of great people at New Adventures, but unfortunately missed more people than I meant to catch up with. <a href="/new-adventures-2011/">Read New Adventures 2011</a>.
