	Today my column on Me and My Big Fat Ego was published on A List Apart. It’s not that I’d say I have a huge ego, but it’s definitely something that’s easily bruised when I feel like things aren’t going my way. <a href="/me-and-my-big-fat-ego-on-a-list-apart/">Read Me and My Big Fat Ego on A List Apart</a>.

	Last week I was guest co-host on one of my most favourite podcasts, Unfinished Business. It was great to ramble and rant with Andy for 90 minutes as it’s not often I get to chat for so long to another designer whose main focus is client work.
We talked about smoking chimps, mentoring and how we can try to help newcomers in the community, tools and techniques for dealing with client feedback, egos and constructive criticism among many other things. <a href="/guest-co-host-on-unfinished-business/">Read Guest co-host on Unfinished Business</a>.

	Design Feast have my answers to their Designer’s Quest(ionnaire) on their site.
Scroll past the scarily large photo of me quickly… their questions prompted me to think about some interesting points, especially challenges for designers:
 What are some of the challenges you encounter as a designer and how do you deal with them?
I think the greatest challenge a designer comes across is their own ego. It’s in our nature, as those that deal in creativity, we have egos that allow us to consider our work good enough to share, and good enough for clients to pay us. <a href="/design-feast-designers-questionnaire/">Read Design Feast Designer’s Quest(ionnaire)</a>.

	Oh Twitter. Yesterday was another day where I accidentally incited another riot with a poorly-worded tweet. Nobody is perfect, but it’s starting to happen with alarming frequency, and I wanted to understand why I keep doing this.
The ever-present ego We read everything through our own ego filter. It’s how we apply new knowledge to our own situations. Whenever we read a tweet, blog post, article, book, watch a TV show, a film, a play, we take in what we’re reading and hearing and apply it to ourselves. <a href="/we-read-with-our-own-contexts/">Read We read with our own contexts</a>.
