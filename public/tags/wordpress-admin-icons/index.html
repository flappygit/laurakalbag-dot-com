	A while ago I wrotea post about how I was going to do a talk at WordPress London where I would try to design a WordPress admin icon live. Well, I did it, and it didn’t go too badly. In fact, I was very lucky as the first suggestion for what I should design was a calendar icon. That’s mostly squares, so not too tricky!
  The final calendar icons (as designed quickly in 30 minutes or so)   The WordPress London guys kindly filmed my talk and I’ve included it below. <a href="/live-designing-wordpress-admin-icons/">Read Live-designing WordPress Admin Icons</a>.

	I’m speaking at the WordPress London January meetup on the 17th of January 2013.
I’ve been using WordPress for years, for my own site and for client sites, and I really love it. I had absolutely no idea what to talk about though. I tend to create custom themes for clients, but these are very different from themes designed for use by many different sites, and so I wasn’t sure whether my experience would be relevant to many people. <a href="/speaking-at-the-wordpress-london-january-meetup/">Read Speaking at the WordPress London January meetup</a>.
