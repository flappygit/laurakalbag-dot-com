		A few weeks ago I gave a workshop in New Zealand about designing inclusive content and accessible design. Afterwards, I was asked for recommended reading on accessible animation. These are a bunch of bookmarks I’ve stored up, and what I’d recommend to get started on designing and building animations in an inclusive way:
Books  Designing Interface Animation by Val Head. Animation At Work by Rachel Nabors.  Articles  Your Interactive Makes Me Sick by Eileen Webb. <a href="/bookmarked-on-animation/">Read Bookmarked: Animation</a>.

		It’s been a few years since I wrote something for 24ways, but this year I’m back, making the case for semantic HTML.
 
As I mention in the article, I see a lot of redundant and unsemantic HTML while I’m working on Better. HTML is often seen as easy, and therefore not worth learning in detail. It’s frustrating because HTML is one of the few completely unavoidable technologies of the web. <a href="/semantic-html-on-24-ways/">Read Semantic HTML on 24 Ways</a>.

		In the spirit of catching up on slightly older news, in January I was part of a panel commenting on BBC Taster on Creative Bloq.
Looking through, I liked the content and the concept interested me, but there were implications for accessibility that concerned me. Overall, I came across as a lot more cynical that the other designers and developers commenting on BBC Taster, but I think it’s important that we look at the bigger picture before we get caught up in the shiny. <a href="/bbc-taster/">Read What do web experts think of BBC Taster?</a>.

		The reason I fell in love with the web was the democratisation of information. I love that so many people can access, learn, and share such a huge variety of resources. That’s why I’ve always considered accessibility so important. To me, access for all is an essential part of the nature of the web.
How I learned accessibility When I started to learn about web design and development, I learned from great books like Dan Cederholm’s Web Standards Solutions. <a href="/why-accessibility-matters-to-me/">Read Why accessibility matters to me #GAAD</a>.

I wanted to write something that could be a go-to for people trying to understand why designing for accessibility was worthwhile. Fingers crossed that this helps, because we can’t talk about accessibility enough!

After spending months whining about grid frameworks, 960.gs and Bootstrap, I’ve finally backed up my tweet-sized complaints with some context and examples.
I knew it would be contentious and that some people would feel antagonised by my saying that developers who don’t consider accessibility shouldn’t be on the web. And possibly also that I suggest some developers lazily fail to customise frameworks to appropriately suit their needs. <a href="/grid-frameworks/">Read Grid Frameworks and why I’m not keen on them…</a>.

		There’s something that’s been bothering me lately. It seems to be some kind of form interface trend where the labels for text inputs are placed inside the fields themselves.
Example:
   There might be some pros Admittedly, this makes an interface slicker. It saves space where you’d usually have a label, then some padding, then the input field and probably a load of padding around the lot. <a href="/labels-in-input-fields-arent-such-a-good-idea/">Read Labels in input fields aren’t such a good idea</a>.
