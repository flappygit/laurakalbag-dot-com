      <description>&lt;p&gt;Andy Clarke is on holiday for three weeks and has handed over the &lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz/&#34;&gt;Unfinished Business&lt;/a&gt; reins to &lt;a href=&#34;http://insurancebyjack.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Ashley Baxter&lt;/a&gt; and I. &lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz/80&#34;&gt;This week’s episode&lt;/a&gt; is all about business insurance for freelancers and small businesses. We talked about public liability, professional indemnity, business contents and copyright infringement. It was great because I got to ask Ashley loads of questions I forgot to ask when she was helping me get insured!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if the audio quality is as good as it usually is on Unfinished Business, as my editing skills are rather rusty… But this episode does feature a little bit of &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/gigapup&#34;&gt;Oskar&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, the wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/iamashley&#34;&gt;Ashley Baxter&lt;/a&gt; asked me about how I got into public speaking. Ashley asked a few cool people, and published their &lt;a href=&#34;http://insurancebyjack.co.uk/business-and-marketing/2014/05/20/how-to-get-started-with-public-speaking.html&#34;&gt;public speaking stories on the Insurance By Jack blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you want business insurance, you really should get a quote from &lt;a href=&#34;http://insurancebyjack.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Insurance By Jack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
