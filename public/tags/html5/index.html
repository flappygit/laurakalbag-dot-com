	There’s something that’s been bothering me lately. It seems to be some kind of form interface trend where the labels for text inputs are placed inside the fields themselves.
Example:
 a form field where the label is shown inside the text input field   There might be some pros Admittedly, this makes an interface slicker. It saves space where you’d usually have a label, then some padding, then the input field and probably a load of padding around the lot. <a href="/labels-in-input-fields-arent-such-a-good-idea/">Read Labels in input fields aren’t such a good idea</a>.

	Big M badge   First off, let me declare my complete bias. I’ve been involved with the Big M conference from pretty early on, I was lucky enough to do all the design work and the organisers are lovely guys who I’m proud to call my friends. I’m still on a high from how much I enjoyed myself (and just about recovered from the surreal feeling of being in a place with my own design work everywhere) so this is really going to be the most biased event review you’ve ever read! <a href="/the-big-m/">Read The Big M</a>.

	My history with Transcending CSS In 2006/early 2007 I read this amazing book. I was half way through my first year studying Digital Design, and I’d only been experimenting with standards-based web design for about six months after reading Web Standards Solutions.
I was already well on my way to being a standards fiend, but Transcending CSS by Andy Clarke did, literally, transcend the standards and made me utterly mad about pushing the boundaries of CSS. <a href="/hardboiled-web-design-and-transcending-css/">Read Hardboiled Web Design and Transcending CSS</a>.

 my copy of HTML5 For Web Designers
