      <description>&lt;p&gt;Next month I’m speaking and running a “creator unit” at border:none in Nuremberg. This is incredibly exciting as it’s an event focused around the decentralisation of the web, a topic that I care about a great deal. I’ll be talking about using considerate design and great user experiences to create genuine alternatives to the products that make money from exploiting their users’ data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also an all-new topic for me to share with other people, so I can’t wait! &lt;a href=&#34;https://border-none.net/2014/tickets&#34;&gt;Tickets for the whole 2-day event&lt;/a&gt; are just 199 euros, and they have a really clever way of matching participants up with the topics they’re interested in, using &lt;a href=&#34;https://border-none.net/2014/tickets#c67&#34;&gt;an “aurora” of interests&lt;/a&gt;. You really should come along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sadly, &lt;a href=&#34;http://interlinkconference.com&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;The End of Interlink&#34;&gt;Interlink conference has been cancelled&lt;/a&gt;. I’m gutted that I won’t be visiting Canada this year, but I totally understand how difficult it is to run a conference, especially if you’re trying to put on the best possible event for your attendees and speakers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m running my &lt;a href=&#34;http://interlinkconference.com/workshops/#design-theory-web&#34;&gt;‘Design theory for the web’ workshop at Interlink conference&lt;/a&gt; in Canada on the 18th of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://interlinkconference.com/workshops/#design-theory-web&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a one day workshop and I’ve written a mega description below for anyone wanting to know more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot more to web design than making something look pretty. I’ll take you through five web design primers, looking at visual design language and how it can be used to communicate with your users, making your sites more usable and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-primers-covered-are&#34;&gt;The primers covered are:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layout and grids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing for responsiveness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessible design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’m a designer and front end developer, I’ll refer to techniques you can use practically on the web today. However, this workshop does not rely on HTML and CSS knowledge so it is perfect for those just starting out in web design, or those wanting to focus on improving their visual design skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;Looking at the hands-on application of design skills, I’ll walk you through the visual design of two website projects. One project will be used to learn the techniques, and one project will be used to apply what we have learned together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;typography&#34;&gt;Typography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we aim to achieve with typography? What makes a good typeface and what makes it suited to a particular project? Text is the foundation of the web and learning typographic principles will help you make your text easier to read, understand and reinforce your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;layout-and-grids&#34;&gt;Layout and grids&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should we use grids? How do we create layouts that work with varied content? Layout design is what makes for sophisticated visual design. Learning about layout and grids will make your site easier to navigate, helping your users find the information they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;colour&#34;&gt;Colour&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any ‘best colours’ for website design? How do we create good colour palettes? Many designers are scared to use colour in their designs. Learning about colour will help you highlight key areas of your site and make your brand stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;designing-for-responsiveness&#34;&gt;Designing for responsiveness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can design principles help us design for the responsive web? What are the pitfalls of responsive web design? Responsive web design makes designing for the web more challenging. Learning about useful working processes and the common pitfalls of responsive design will help you make your site more future friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;accessible-design&#34;&gt;Accessible design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes design accessible? What can we do to make our sites better for a wider audience? Accessibility isn’t just about disabilities. Learning about how important design is to accessibility will make your site a better experience for as many users as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Design theory for the web, a workshop</title>

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a slightly scary thing: I’m doing &lt;a href=&#34;http://makedo.in/design-theory-for-the-web/&#34;&gt;my first solo workshop on the 11th October 2013 in Barnsley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often get asked about the best way to “learn design”, and I usually say that you learn by doing and you learn by watching how others do it. In this workshop, I want to give new designers, developers, and anybody else wanting to learn how to design for the web, a good foundation with five primers, a bit of doing and a bit of watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a low-cost workshop. The early bird tickets are just £125, and the full-price tickets are just £165. Fancy joining me for the day? &lt;a href=&#34;http://makedo.in/design-theory-for-the-web/#nav-register&#34;&gt;Grab a ticket from the makedo site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        Good luck on your first solo workshop, although I’m sure you’ll be great at it.

One thing, how suitable is this for a developer who’s looking to understand more about design? I don’t have much of a design background at all, mostly a server-side developer.

        Thanks Neil :)

It’s absolutely aimed at developers and beginners who are new to designing for the web. More experienced designers might pick up some tips and tricks, but my main focus is the beginners.

      <title>CreativeJS for non-coders workshop with Seb Lee-Delisle</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/creativejs-for-non-coders/</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;programming-block&#34;&gt;Programming block&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a bit scared of JavaScript. Since I started learning front-end development about seven years ago, I’ve pretty much stayed away from it. That aside from some pretty dodgy jQuery where I can usually bodge something together but would never rely on it. I’ve always said it’s because I wanted to be &lt;em&gt;really really&lt;/em&gt; good at HTML first, and &lt;strong&gt;then&lt;/strong&gt; CSS and &lt;strong&gt;then&lt;/strong&gt; JavaScript, but I somehow always stopped short of actually learning JavaScript properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because I was scared of it. I might be able to put together some basic PHP when working with WordPress, but I really wouldn’t consider myself a programmer. The less that the code I’m writing has an instant visual output, the more I get confused by it. I’ve tried to learn all sorts of different languages but they always go in one ear and out the other. I had just settled for knowing enough to be able to know what the right solution should be and finding someone clever to help me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;there-s-a-lot-of-javascript-on-the-web&#34;&gt;There’s a lot of JavaScript on the web&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem was, that in doing this, I was really limiting myself. There’s a lot of JavaScript on the web. Even if you’re not using it to do something fancy on a site, if you’re a modern developer using progressive enhancement then chances are you’re using some kind of shiv or polyfill that relies on JavaScript. It’s pretty hypocritical of me if I go around saying I don’t use HTML and CSS frameworks, because writing all my own markup from scratch means I understand every little bit of it, when I don’t really understand the shivs and polyfills I’m using to help me use elements of HTML5 and CSS3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;creativejs-for-non-coders-workshop&#34;&gt;CreativeJS for non-coders workshop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://seb.ly&#34;&gt;Seb Lee-Delisle&lt;/a&gt; was putting on another couple of &lt;a href=&#34;http://seb.ly/training/&#34;&gt;workshops teaching CreativeJS&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone I’d known that had been to one of Seb’s workshops had said it was incredibly worthwhile and good fun. I didn’t have an excuse to put off learning JavaScript. And whilst I go to a lot of conferences, I’d not been to a proper two day workshop before so I wasn’t really sure what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;attachment_1194 wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-1194&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2012/10/seb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Seb at the CreativeJS for non-coders workshop&#34;/&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;creativejs&#34;&gt;CreativeJS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seb has a creative angle on JavaScript as he’s really an artist who uses programming as one of his tools rather than a stereotypical ‘coder’. The whole workshop is based around learning how to create cool visual effects, interactive elements and animations rather than tedious examples of toggle menus and form validation. This really helped me get my head around the JavaScript we were using as it all had very visible, visual results. There was a practical use for all the code that we were taught, but we could play with it in more creative ways. Seb showed us loads of cool, complex examples of what other artists were doing with programming right at the beginning of the workshop and this helped deliver a good dose of inspiration into our heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;non-coder&#34;&gt;Non-coder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opted for the non-coder workshop (Seb also runs a more advanced CreativeJS and HTML5 2D workshop) as I really knew very little code. Whilst I could copy and paste a few things into something that vaguely works on the web, I didn’t really understand any of the core concepts of programming. This was the right choice for me as I continually felt challenged by the exercises set by Seb without feeling completely out of my depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-did-i-make&#34;&gt;So what did I make?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of two days, we played with a lot of fun demos and exercises, coding along with Seb and then being challenged to try new tasks out for ourselves. The part I’m most proud of is the Pong-like game that I created. I wrote every bit of this code by myself, some whilst following Seb’s instructions, and some by testing my knowledge of what I’d just been taught. This feels like a massive achievement for me, I don’t just feel like I’ve parroted a load of code, I feel like I &lt;strong&gt;actually understand it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://sebly.jsbin.com/icifow/5/embed?live&#34;&gt;View it on the CreativeJS graphics playground&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-another-thing-i-learnt&#34;&gt;And another thing I learnt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d previously always consider coding as something you did &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; design, but Seb’s workshop showed me that you can actually come up with new ideas just playing with the code. Just like in painting, drawing or designing, where you can have ‘happy accidents’, we seemed to frequently have these same serendipitous moments just mucking about with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-really-really-really-recommend-you-give-it-a-go&#34;&gt;I really really really recommend you give it a go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn JavaScript, or learn more creative ways to use your knowledge, I couldn’t recommend Seb’s workshops more. You can find out more on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://seb.ly/training/&#34;&gt;training section of Seb’s site&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ve just noticed he’s got another &lt;a href=&#34;http://seb.ly/training/&#34;&gt;CreativeJS for non-coders workshop on in December&lt;/a&gt; (that’d be a great early Christmas present!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even if you don’t end up going to a workshop, you should check out Seb’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://seb.ly/work/&#34;&gt;mad fun projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/aside&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;comment-entry&#34;&gt;
        I’ve been a designer and front-end developer for more than a few years and, like you, JavaScript confuses me. I’ve survived using many of the techniques you described above, but I have to admit that I don’t really know how the code I copy/paste is actually working. I’ve come to grips that I’ll likely never be ‘good’ at any programming language like PHP, but as a responsible front-ender I should at least be proficient at JavaScript.

I’ve been doing Codecademy and tinkering with JS more. You’ve completely sold me on Seb’s workshops! I’ll keep an eye out for next time he’ll be on my side of the pond.

Thanks for posting this. I feel less alone seeing someone like you going through some of the same things. Cheers!
    &lt;/div&gt;

        really nice and motivational post Laura! I live far from Sebs workshops, so i’m still waiting for the online version, but your comments made me really curious about it and a lot more hopefully about the js learning, thankss!
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
