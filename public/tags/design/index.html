	I was just asked, amongst a couple of other questions, what advice I would give to aspiring designers or typographers.
With my mind focused on the aspiration part, I started writing an answer based on finding your own way of working through studying others, not copying… And then I realised it was a bit superficial. What’s the biggest problem with young designers today? They’re coin-operated*. So I wrote what I hope is slightly better advice: <a href="/advice-for-aspiring-designers/">Read What advice do you give to aspiring designers or typographers?</a>.

	I’m about to apply a mute filter to the word “flat” on Twitter. That or start unfollowing a lot of people.
What’s flat? There’s an aesthetic “trend” that’s been around for a while. It involves fewer gradients and textures and has thus been described as “flat” design. It’s often described as the opposite of “skeuomorphism,” (which is an equally irritating word when used in this way.) It was popularised by Windows Metro&nbsp;and, being an aesthetic associated with fewer images, and thus better performance and more flexibility in the development of interfaces, has been a feature of many designs in both apps and on the web. <a href="/flat-design-trend/">Read Fl&amp;#42;t design trend</a>.

 What are some of the challenges you encounter as a designer and how do you deal with them?
I think the greatest challenge a designer comes across is their own ego. It’s in our nature, as those that deal in creativity, we have egos that allow us to consider our work good enough to share, and good enough for clients to pay us. <a href="/design-feast-designers-questionnaire/">Read Design Feast Designer’s Quest(ionnaire)</a>.

   Mobile design and development has gained momentum over the last few years; with responsive design and designers regularly going giddy over iPhone app UIs, it’s surprising how little the industry discusses the *design* issues. We seem to prefer to get caught up in the more technical and development-based conversations (or the infuriatingly dull native vs web, but I’ll get back to that! <a href="/mobile-first/">Read Mobile First</a>.

	There’s one thing that I hate about being a designer and that’s the snobbery. Most, if not all, designers are a little bit guilty of looking down on other people’s work. Comments such as “Pah! They used Comic Sans” or “Ergh! Don’t they know reflections are so out of date now?”
These are comments I’m 100% guilty of saying, but I think the problem is the outlet. If it’s a quick chatter between friends then there’s not much lost except making yourself look like a bit of an arse, but start broadcasting these harsh judgements to the world and you’ll rapidly give the impression of a big ego, huge mouth and tiny brain. <a href="/good-old-designer-snobbery-is-live-and-kicking/">Read Good old designer snobbery is alive and kicking</a>.
