      <title>What advice do you give to aspiring designers or typographers?</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I was just asked, amongst a couple of other questions, what advice I would give to aspiring designers or typographers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my mind focused on the aspiration part, I started writing an answer based on finding your own way of working through studying others, not copying… And then I realised it was a bit &lt;em&gt;superficial&lt;/em&gt;. What’s the biggest problem with young designers today? They’re coin-operated&lt;a href=&#34;#coin-operated&#34;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;. So I wrote what I hope is slightly better advice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be ethical. Design is a great power where you can choose to instruct and manipulate others into thinking, feeling, and acting. Use those powers for good, don’t promote or help those whose business and goals harm people. Work hard to build a society you want to inhabit in the long term. Don’t underestimate your own impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* &lt;a href=&#34;https://ar.al&#34;&gt;Aral&lt;/a&gt; came up with that term. I just love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;one-comment&#34;&gt;One comment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol class=&#34;commentlist&#34;&gt;
    &lt;li class=&#34;comment even thread-even depth-1&#34; id=&#34;li-comment-146596&#34;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&#34;comment-author vcard&#34;&gt;
            &lt;img alt=&#39;&#39; src=&#39;https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/06dd590ce0771be9e44af9efacb0cb76?s=72&amp;amp;d=mm&amp;amp;r=g&#39; srcset=&#39;https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/06dd590ce0771be9e44af9efacb0cb76?s=144&amp;amp;d=mm&amp;amp;r=g 2x&#39; class=&#39;avatar avatar-72 photo&#39; height=&#39;72&#39; width=&#39;72&#39; /&gt;&lt;cite class=&#34;fn&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.greavesdesign.co.uk&#39; rel=&#39;external nofollow&#39; class=&#39;url&#39;&gt;David&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
                &lt;aside class=&#34;comment-meta commentmetadata&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#comment-146596&#34;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&#34;2016-04-27T10:32:45+00:00&#34; pubdate class=&#34;published&#34;&gt;
         at &lt;span class=&#34;hours&#34;&gt;10:32am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/aside&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;comment-entry&#34;&gt;
        I would say focus on the one thing you are good at and master that skill and style, don’t get distracted thinking you need to know everything about anything. Such as if youre thing is vector graphics become the best at it, or if you use illustrator get to know it inside out. Hope that’s helpful advice for someone.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Accessibility By Design</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/12-days-of-podcasts-day-3/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday morning I gave a talk online for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.inclusivedesign24.org&#34;&gt;Inclusive Design 24&lt;/a&gt;, a free 24-hour event celebrating Global Accessibility Awareness Day (#GAAD.) I wanted to share my talk in a more readable way, so here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.001.jpg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last two years, I’ve given eleven accessibility-related talks, almost entirely on an introductory level. I want to go into a group of people who work with the web, and convince them to make their sites more accessible, no matter what their role or position. If they’ve not heard of accessibility before, then it’s not usually a hard sell. It’s hopeful, positive and appeals to peoples’ good sides. But if they have heard of accessibility it’s a much harder sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As web professionals, we come up with so many reasons to avoid accessibility. It’s not often one solid reason but a hazy combination of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we don’t understand who we’re trying to help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we’re not sure what to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s hard, and there’s too much to think about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a href=&#34;http://24ways.org/2013/why-bother-with-accessibility/&#34;&gt;addressed these reasons before&lt;/a&gt;, so I won’t cover them here, but it’s important for us to understand why we think this way. We think along a decision-making scale that goes from easy things to impossible things. The reasons I mentioned before aren’t really excuses, but are mapped to different locations on the scale based on how a person perceives the difficulty of accessibility in relation to their job and its associated tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.006.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4691&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.006.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Scale with easy and one end, and hard at the other&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One developer might see learning Angular as a challenge, but another developer might already know Angular and so see it as an easy decision. One content strategist might have worked with lots of video, but another might be more experienced working with text. One designer might create prototypes in HTML and CSS, but another might work exclusively in Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.010.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4692&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.010.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Easy to hard scale with Angular in different locations depending on the developer&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we’re working on a project, we have to balance all the factors and features on our difficulty scale. There are easy wins we can incorporate into projects without thinking about it: this could be the decision to use text to communicate on our sites. You might think: “Using text on a web page? It goes without saying!” But somebody has to write that text, so it’s not really a given. Instead it’s an easy win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are impossibilities that we’ll (probably) never try on our projects: this could be the decision to make our site scroll on the Z axis, out of the screen, into some kind of cool 3D hologram between the viewer and their screen. It’d be incredibly difficult to achieve, and probably completely irrelevant to our project, so we’re never going to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all other decisions are somewhere between text on a web page and Z axis hologram scrolling. We’ll decide an approach or a feature’s worth based on its position on this scale, and based on how many other things are on the scale. Do we have a lot of easy wins on the scale? Well, maybe we can do one difficult thing. Do we have a lot of moderately tricky tasks on the scale? Then maybe one of them has to go, based on our budget or how much time we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.009.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4693&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As people trying to promote accessibility, we need to help pull accessibility up from the “difficult” end of the scale, towards the “easy” end of the scale. How we approach making accessibility easier depends on who we’re trying to encourage. Give a copy writer an alt attribute and they’ll have a more accessible image. Teach a copy writer how write alt attributes, and they’ll have accessible images for a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.014.jpg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve mostly found developers and content creators fairly easy to convince about accessibility. The most trouble I seem to get is from designers. Which is strange because &lt;em&gt;I’m&lt;/em&gt; a designer. So why are designers a sticking point? When our content is fabulous, our markup and code is well-structured and thoughtful, even our interactive behaviour is well planned, but the visual side lets us down. Aesthetics are often even the &lt;em&gt;enemy&lt;/em&gt; of accessibility, how can we change that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;differences-between-design-decoration-and-aesthetics&#34;&gt;Differences between design, decoration and aesthetics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does a designer do? It’s probably one of the most contentious job titles in the web world. “Designer” tends to be applied to people who work on the visual side. A designer might work on UX (user experience), or experience design, which is usually focused on what you &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; see as much as what you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; see. Sometimes a designer is described as a “visual designer” to be extra clear. It’s these kinds of designers I’m going to discuss now. &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; do this kind of design. I also do other types of design at the same time. But when I’m working in this area of design, I call it “aesthetics.” It’s the stuff you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aesthetics isn’t just decoration. Decoration does very little. Decoration is the pretty stuff. If I had a pound for every time a client tried to employ me to add some decoration to their ugly site in the hope people would enjoy using it more, I’d have been a wealthy freelancer. But adding pretty bits to a site won’t make it a better experience. It’ll just make it an awful experience with bells on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why when I usually talk about design, I don’t just talk about the work created by the people with the job title of ‘designer’. Design is a problem-solving practice. Everybody on a team does it. Content strategists do it when they decide on a direction and approach for a product. Developers do it when they choose a framework or a coding language. Designers do it when they pick a layout. Every decision we make that has an impact on the final product is design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-makes-the-difference-between-pretty-effective-and-just-pretty&#34;&gt;What makes the difference between pretty effective and just pretty?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use aesthetics to help convey the message in our content. That’s why the study of design is often called ‘Visual Communication.’ Communicating in a visual way aims to create media that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;draws people into the content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assists people in understanding content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encourages people to respond to content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We achieve these goals by applying typography, colour, layout and form in a way that represents the meaning of the content, makes it easy to understand, and makes it easy to interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to find design that fails in these goals. There’s a lot of stuff out there that looks good at a glance, and at drawing you in, but is impossible to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;anti-accessibility-aesthetic-trends&#34;&gt;Anti-accessibility aesthetic trends&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a deliberately inflammatory title… I had a look at what the gallery websites reckon were the trends of the last four years. A disclaimer comes here as I don’t think anyone using these trends sets out to make their sites inaccessible. The examples following may well be incredibly accessible. These examples are just to show how these trends could compromise usability in favour of looking sexy and fashionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.035.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4695&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2012-was-the-year-of-the-grid-system&#34;&gt;2012 was the year of the grid system&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With responsive design becoming the rage, grid systems were abound in 2012. Frameworks popped up everywhere. Some frameworks, used responsibly, were great, making responsive layouts and prototyping very easy. However, most frameworks resulted in &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lt;div&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lt;span&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; soup when developers used them without any customisation or care for accessibility. There wasn’t a meaningful HTML element in sight…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.037.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4696&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.037.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshots of lots of grid frameworks&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2012 also heralded image carousels, back then still referred to as “sliders.” Designers could now cram extra content on to the page through the wonder of jQuery and other scripts. Unfortunately, the accessibility of the content, and the controls that helped you stop, advance, and rewind the content whizzing before your eyes, was not usually a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.040.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4697&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.040.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;2013&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2013-was-the-year-of-parallax&#34;&gt;2013 was the Year of Parallax&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scrolling with combined static and moving layers was the done thing. Rich content and storytelling made for compelling experiences, but also image-heavy pages that hijacked input conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.042.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4698&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.042.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshots of websites that use parallax scrolling&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2013 was also the year flat design started becoming “a thing.” Textures and images lost favour as responsive design meant the elements on our pages needed to be flexible. ‘Flat Design’ with its solid blocks of colour could be created easily with CSS, load quickly, and expand and collapse to fit the viewport size with no loss of quality. This meant it was also the year designers learned how to spell new words as they endlessly argued the merits of flat design vs &lt;strong&gt;skeuomorphism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.044.jpg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.045.jpg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2014-year-of-the-video-background&#34;&gt;2014, Year of the Video Background&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video backgrounds became big in 2014. I’m not even sure why, as these videos probably only ran smoothly on the large desktop screens of the designers working at mega corporations with extra speedy fibre-optic internet connections. The rest of us have to put up with slow, choppy and pixelated videos making the layouts distracting, and making it hard to read the text overlaid on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.047.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4701&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.047.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshots of web pages with video backgrounds&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking around at sites that predict and analyse the trends so far for 2015, there’s not much that’s new out there. A few sites have mentioned simplicity becoming a trend, and as long as that doesn’t just mean hiding stuff, that may be a good thing. It might mean that web design is finally growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;constraints&#34;&gt;Constraints&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see from the trends how much designers crave constraint. Fashion is a constraint. It’s much easier to come up with a design when you know what you have to do in order to be “cool” or “modern.” Charles Eames said that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Design depends largely on constraints.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.050.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4702&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.050.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Design depends largely on constraints - Charles Eames&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a designer working in furniture, architecture, film, art, graphic and industrial design, Charles Eames understood that constraints affect design no matter the discipline. A designer’s work is to respond to requirements or aims set by others or ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the web, constraints come in all different forms, some bigger than others. There are some overarching constraints that affect every project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-constraints&#34;&gt;Project constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each project comes with its own unique constraints dependent on its owners and their goals. A typical example of a project constraint might be existing brand guidelines. You have a particular logo, colour palette, tone of voice, and typographic system that has to be used on the project, and every other decision has to work around those constraints. You might have an existing content management system that dictates the framework and language you can use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;medium-technology-constraints&#34;&gt;Medium/technology constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we communicate in print, paper and ink is expensive. Newspapers look the way they do because we had to try to fit lots of text into tight columns on a few sheets of paper. When we communicate on the web, we avoid using massive images on every page because bandwidth is expensive. We compress our images, and try to optimise their appearance on different screen sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;audience-constraints&#34;&gt;Audience constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audience constraints can also be seen as constraints through convention. They’re are certain ways we approach the web based on the activity and expectations of our audience. Why don’t more websites use horizontal scrolling? Because a lot of people don’t know how to scroll horizontally, so they might miss important content. Search boxes are usually in the top right of the page because people started doing it, and then so many people were doing it that we came to expect search boxes on the top right of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;time-constraints&#34;&gt;Time constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is one of the most obvious constraints we have when working on a project. Even if we’re working on a constantly-evolving publishing project, there will be sub-projects within it. Such as articles and updates, that will be subject to a time frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;budget-constraints&#34;&gt;Budget constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Budget and time combined forms the strongest constraints. As these constraints will constrain everything else within a project. Budget will put constraints on time, and time tends to push the limits of budget. This is why budget and time are often used as reasons to avoid accessibility. “We don’t have enough time to make our site accessible,” or “we don’t have enough money to make our site accessible” are two of the most common excuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these excuses aren’t good enough. I probably don’t need to explain the value of making a site accessible. There’s some truth in a little more budget and time being needed for accessibility; whether it’s through training, research, testing, or additional design and development time. But no more than is needed for the consideration of these other core constraints. Nobody would ever say that there wasn’t time or money enough to consider web performance as a constraint. The expense of not considering web performance is far too high. What we need to convey to people is that not considering accessibility is also expensive. It costs a huge amount in lost audience, and a lack of usability for the remaining audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think accessibility belongs on this list as a core constraint that we consider as part of every project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project constraints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medium/technology constraints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audience constraints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time constraints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budget constraints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility constraints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, it could be a sub-set of audience constraints, but including it in that way could lead to the misunderstanding that people with accessibility needs are a sub-set of the overall audience, rather than looking at it from a universal design—everybody benefits from accessibility—approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;designers-understand-constraints&#34;&gt;Designers understand constraints&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we’re trying to convince designers to work with accessibility as a constraint, it shouldn’t be so difficult. Designers are used to working with much smaller and more specific constraints in the field of aesthetic design. When designers are learning their practice, they learn rules about typography, colour, layout, and form; and only once they understand these constraints, they learn how they can break out of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s look at the four pillars of aesthetic design, and the constraints therein:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aesthetic-design-and-the-accessibility-constraints&#34;&gt;Aesthetic design and the accessibility constraints&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;typography&#34;&gt;Typography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look at web typography from an aesthetic point of view, we have two major areas to consider: the technical and the practical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;technical-typography&#34;&gt;Technical typography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical part of web typography is considering how a font might look applied straight to text without any interference/fancy CSS typesetting, or any control over it whatsoever. Because this is what we work with on a basic level without JavaScript or the CSS that only works on a few platforms. We also need to consider how it renders cross-browser. Looking at fonts through progressive enhancement and cross-browser consistency is definitely an accessible approach to typography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.066.jpg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;practical-typography&#34;&gt;Practical typography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s slightly less obvious when it comes to the practical part of web typography. In order to choose typefaces that work for our projects, we need to really understand what we want from a typeface, and what we aim to achieve through typography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to remember that typography exists to represent content, and so it’s always worthwhile to read the text before we design it. Our aim is to invite the reader in, and make the text appear easy to read, not an intimidating mass. Typography should also reveal the meaning of the text. Comic Sans isn’t appropriate for a formal restaurant site, and a swirling script typeface isn’t appropriate for the website of a party clown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.070.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4705&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.070.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A paragraph set in Blackoak Std, and a paragraph set in Heinemann&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Blackoak Std makes for chunky intimidating body text, Heinemann makes for a more inviting paragraph.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we read through the text, we can understand where it needs special treatment: where does the structure and order need to be made clear? The connections and differences between elements should be shown. The visual relationships between the text and other elements should reflect their real relationship. A heading is more important than a paragraph, and its importance should be revealed through size differences at the very least. All of these factors can be combined together to induce an ideal state for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.073.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4706&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.073.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A paragraph with larger and smaller headings&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Clear headings, links, and typographic hierarchy.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest win in accessible typography is just getting the text at a readable size. The most readable typeface is unreadable at a small size, yet so many sizes squeeze tiny text so they can fit more into a layout. Responsive design should have made it more obvious that scrolling is perfectly acceptable. The smaller the x-height (the height of a lowercase x), the bigger your text will need to be in order to be readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.071.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4707&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.071.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Different sized paragraphs at 10px, 12px, 18px and 24px&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;readability&#34;&gt;Readability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst good structure and a strong differentiation between elements will help a reader understand how to read the text, the key to accessible typography is in choosing a readable font.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniform texture is more important than the shapes of the individual characters in a typeface. Typography isn’t the same as logo design. When we look at the relationship between the letters, an even texture helps our eyes flow over the text, not getting caught up on unexpected spaces and distracting shapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.077.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4708&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.077.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Paragraphs of uniform and uneven texture&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		If you squint at the top paragraph, it has an even texture. If you squint at the lower paragraph, it’s a much more blobby, uneven texture.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since high resolution displays became the designers’ favourite, thin text is all the rage. Apple did it, and now everybody else does too. But so often thin text is just too thin, making the text appear very light against the background, making it harder to read. Heavy text also doesn’t provide enough contrast between the text and the background, as its chunkiness makes it hard to distinguish letterforms. You want to choose the Goldilocks of typeface weights: not too heavy, not too light. A high contrast of crisp letterforms with enough space around and between the shapes will make text much easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.078.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4709&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.078.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Light and heavy paragraphs of text&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lines of each letterform also need attention. Serif fonts, in particular, often contrast thick and thin lines within one letter. Your eyes are naturally drawn to the thick lines, and less to the thin, which creates an uneven and distracting texture, making it harder to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.079.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4710&#34;&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		High-contrast serif
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also want to avoid complex details in the letterforms. The loops in Giddyup Std are cute, but overcrowd body text too much. You can see how our reading would be disrupted and tripped up by a loop or a curl in an unusual place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.080.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4711&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature of letterforms that affects the readability of a typeface is the counters. These are the spaces inside the letters. Sometimes they’re open, like Cs, and sometimes they’re closed, like Os. We need a clear distinction between the open and closed counters, so you can easily tell them apart. Otherwise a phrase like Rococo Cocoon could easily be misread as Rooooo Ooooon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.081.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4712&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.081.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Embrionic has very closed counters, Museo Sans has more open counters&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some typefaces are specifically designed to be easier for people with cognitive difficulties. Heinemann is a beautiful typeface designed in-house at Heinemann educational publishing for young readers. The ascenders and descenders (the parts of the letters that ascend above the lowercase letters, and the parts that descend below the lowercase letters) are emphasised to make it easier for readers to distinguish between letters. The letterforms such as lowercase a and g are drawn in the same shape as we learn to write by hand, to make them more recognisable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-heinemann/heinemann/gallery.html&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4713&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.083.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Heinemann type family&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many designers look down on Comic Sans, it shares those same early-learner letterforms as Heinemann, and is often favoured by teachers in classrooms as the letterforms are the same as those the children are using when they’re learning to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/comic-sans/&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4714&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read Regular, Dyslexie and Open Dyslexic are both fonts designed with dyslexic readers in mind, but with very different approaches. Read Regular is more similar to Heinemann in that it takes a sans serif style, and simple letterforms to assist in readability. However Dyslexie and Open Dyslexic take a very different approach, with noticeably heavier sections around the baseline to prevent readers from accidentally reading the letters upside down (a common issue in dyslexia.) The counters have been opened up, and similar looking letters (such as n and m, or vwy), have been adjusted in shape and height so they look different, and are easier to tell apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;colour&#34;&gt;Colour&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-we-interact-with-colour&#34;&gt;How we interact with colour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we’re designing for the web, we tend interact with colour via colour pickers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.088.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4717&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.088.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Colour pickers&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Colour wheel (left) is a more classic layout, with blended hues in a ring. The colour spectrum on the right is more recognisable as it takes the blends you see in the colour wheel, and adds white and black to give you varying shades. The bars in the middle are usually sliders, and allow you to slide between different hues, saturation and brightness for your chosen colour.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of using hues visualised on a colour wheel is that you’re more likely to find colours that work well in a palette. You can pick from side-by-side colours for an analogous blend, or from colours opposite each other on the wheel for a more striking colour contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.096.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4718&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.096.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Colour picking with droppers on opposite sides of the colour wheel&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Colour picking from opposite sides of the colour wheel
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the accessibility of colour is more than just picking two different colours. In order to make our foreground text readable against our background colour, we need &lt;strong&gt;contrast&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we’re trying to find a good contrast, the colour wheel isn’t much help. The key is the sliders for brightness and saturation. A high contrast is caused by a greater difference the foreground and background brightness, and the foreground and background saturation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.105.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4719&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.105.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Varying the brightness for colour contrast&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Varying the brightness for colour contrast
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a blue background with blue text of a similar lightness will be hard to read, whereas a lighter blue against a darker blue is much easier, making a more accessible foreground-background contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.106.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4720&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.106.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Different strengths of saturation, with greater difference comes higher contrast&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Varying the saturation for colour contrast
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same applies to saturation. Deeply saturated yellow text will have a low contrast against a similarly deeply saturated yellow. However, using a desaturated yellow in the background makes for a more accessible foreground-background contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.107.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4721&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.107.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;High contrast with different colours, but the same contrast between brightness and saturation as before&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Using the different colour pairs with the same brightness and saturation as before
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same rules apply even when you’re using different colours for the foreground and background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very high contrast foreground and background combinations can also suffer from accessibility problems. Issues with high contrast aren’t talked about as often, but can hurt your eyes, and be particularly problematic for people with dyslexia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.108.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4722&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid screaming high contrast, I would recommend softening the difference between the foreground and background values slightly, bringing one value slightly closer to the other. By tweaking these contrasts slightly, they’re much easier on the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.109.jpg&#34;&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;accessibility-and-branding&#34;&gt;Accessibility and Branding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we considered accessibility at a brand level, what would that be like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we designed our logos and associated colour palettes with an accessible colour contrast in mind? I’ve been doing this for years, not really thinking much of it. As a designer who usually created a logo and would then go on to design and develop a site around it, it just made sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.111.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4724&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.111.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Logo designs with accessible text colours&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Some of my old logo designs
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we make the colours accessible, then the colours we use on the site can be consistently on-brand later on; we won’t suddenly need to use a darker colour for our body text because our brand’s colour palette produces unreadable results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.113.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4725&#34;&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Some early designs for logos, with accessible, web-compatible typography
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we choose our logo and brand typefaces with readability and web typography in mind, not just which typeface has three letters that look good for our logo? Maybe if our logo is a swirling script face, we should consider a complementary body text early on, when we’re designing the rest of our brand. This could prevent us getting caught out when our site designer or developer has to pick a completely off-brand typeface because our brand typography is so hard to read as body text.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earlier we, as designers, learn to consider accessibility, the less likely we’ll have our designs diluted and confused further down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;strategies-for-involving-accessibility-from-the-beginning-of-the-design-process&#34;&gt;Strategies for involving accessibility from the beginning of the design process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have a few simple strategies for involving accessibility from the beginning of the design process…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;understanding-accessibility&#34;&gt;Understanding accessibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just understanding why it’s worth making our sites accessible is a big first step. Only the most foolish people would learn a little about accessibility and not hold it in their heads for every future project. I don’t mean having to become an expert overnight, but just knowing little tips and tricks to make sites better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;constraints-1&#34;&gt;Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering accessibility as a constraint is a complementary to the other strategies. It’s a more specific way of thinking, as you’re always referring back to accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sitting-in-on-testing-and-focus-groups&#34;&gt;Sitting in on testing and focus groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we hear and witness the experiences of others, it’s much easier to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) understand how other people don’t interact with the web in the same way we do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) understand the multitude of ways people CAN interact with the web and how we might better serve their needs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;being-involved-in-human-research&#34;&gt;Being involved in human research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being involved in human research is very similar to the previous point, but is more about being ahead of the work, rather than behind it. We need to be researching and understanding human interaction before we start a single task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we’re only discovering issues with accessibility in a later testing phase, we’re already behind the curve.&lt;/p&gt;
In the talk I gave this morning, I then went on to talk about the 3 Rs of Ethical Design. But rather than explain it to you here, I think you should &lt;a href=&#34;https://ind.ie/you-are-the-product/&#34;&gt;watch Aral cover it in his talk Beyond The Camera Panopticon: You Are The Product&lt;/a&gt; (the part on Ethical Design starts at around the 53 minute mark.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-accessibility-more-accessible&#34;&gt;Make accessibility more accessible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to make accessibility more accessible to different roles in our organisations, we need to learn how to better incorporate it into our existing processes. Acknowledging accessibility as a constraint from the outset ensures we have it as a point of reference at every step in the process. This also deliberately avoids looking at accessibility as some kind of checklist. Designers need to understand that accessibility can no more be ticked off a list than user experience can. These aren’t checklist tasks, but are our goals, our focuses, and our approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.132.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4727&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that was my talk. Some of these thoughts are more developed than others. If you have any comments or want to discuss these things further, I’d love to hear what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday morning I gave a talk online for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.inclusivedesign24.org&#34;&gt;Inclusive Design 24&lt;/a&gt;, a free 24-hour event celebrating Global Accessibility Awareness Day (#GAAD.) I wanted to share my talk in a more readable way, so here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.001.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4690&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last two years, I’ve given eleven accessibility-related talks, almost entirely on an introductory level. I want to go into a group of people who work with the web, and convince them to make their sites more accessible, no matter what their role or position. If they’ve not heard of accessibility before, then it’s not usually a hard sell. It’s hopeful, positive and appeals to peoples’ good sides. But if they have heard of accessibility it’s a much harder sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As web professionals, we come up with so many reasons to avoid accessibility. It’s not often one solid reason but a hazy combination of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we don’t understand who we’re trying to help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we’re not sure what to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s hard, and there’s too much to think about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a href=&#34;http://24ways.org/2013/why-bother-with-accessibility/&#34;&gt;addressed these reasons before&lt;/a&gt;, so I won’t cover them here, but it’s important for us to understand why we think this way. We think along a decision-making scale that goes from easy things to impossible things. The reasons I mentioned before aren’t really excuses, but are mapped to different locations on the scale based on how a person perceives the difficulty of accessibility in relation to their job and its associated tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.006.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4691&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.006.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Scale with easy and one end, and hard at the other&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One developer might see learning Angular as a challenge, but another developer might already know Angular and so see it as an easy decision. One content strategist might have worked with lots of video, but another might be more experienced working with text. One designer might create prototypes in HTML and CSS, but another might work exclusively in Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.010.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4692&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.010.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Easy to hard scale with Angular in different locations depending on the developer&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we’re working on a project, we have to balance all the factors and features on our difficulty scale. There are easy wins we can incorporate into projects without thinking about it: this could be the decision to use text to communicate on our sites. You might think: “Using text on a web page? It goes without saying!” But somebody has to write that text, so it’s not really a given. Instead it’s an easy win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are impossibilities that we’ll (probably) never try on our projects: this could be the decision to make our site scroll on the Z axis, out of the screen, into some kind of cool 3D hologram between the viewer and their screen. It’d be incredibly difficult to achieve, and probably completely irrelevant to our project, so we’re never going to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all other decisions are somewhere between text on a web page and Z axis hologram scrolling. We’ll decide an approach or a feature’s worth based on its position on this scale, and based on how many other things are on the scale. Do we have a lot of easy wins on the scale? Well, maybe we can do one difficult thing. Do we have a lot of moderately tricky tasks on the scale? Then maybe one of them has to go, based on our budget or how much time we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.009.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4693&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.009.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Scale of difficulty with text content at easy and z-axis scrolling at hard&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As people trying to promote accessibility, we need to help pull accessibility up from the “difficult” end of the scale, towards the “easy” end of the scale. How we approach making accessibility easier depends on who we’re trying to encourage. Give a copy writer an alt attribute and they’ll have a more accessible image. Teach a copy writer how write alt attributes, and they’ll have accessible images for a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.014.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4694&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.014.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Pulling accessibility up from the hard end of the scale to the easy end&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve mostly found developers and content creators fairly easy to convince about accessibility. The most trouble I seem to get is from designers. Which is strange because &lt;em&gt;I’m&lt;/em&gt; a designer. So why are designers a sticking point? When our content is fabulous, our markup and code is well-structured and thoughtful, even our interactive behaviour is well planned, but the visual side lets us down. Aesthetics are often even the *enemy* of accessibility, how can we change that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;differences-between-design-decoration-and-aesthetics&#34;&gt;Differences between design, decoration and aesthetics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does a designer do? It’s probably one of the most contentious job titles in the web world. “Designer” tends to be applied to people who work on the visual side. A designer might work on UX (user experience), or experience design, which is usually focused on what you &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; see as much as what you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; see. Sometimes a designer is described as a “visual designer” to be extra clear. It’s these kinds of designers I’m going to discuss now. &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; do this kind of design. I also do other types of design at the same time. But when I’m working in this area of design, I call it “aesthetics.” It’s the stuff you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aesthetics isn’t just decoration. Decoration does very little. Decoration is the pretty stuff. If I had a pound for every time a client tried to employ me to add some decoration to their ugly site in the hope people would enjoy using it more, I’d have been a wealthy freelancer. But adding pretty bits to a site won’t make it a better experience. It’ll just make it an awful experience with bells on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why when I usually talk about design, I don’t just talk about the work created by the people with the job title of ‘designer’. Design is a problem-solving practice. Everybody on a team does it. Content strategists do it when they decide on a direction and approach for a product. Developers do it when they choose a framework or a coding language. Designers do it when they pick a layout. Every decision we make that has an impact on the final product is design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-makes-the-difference-between-pretty-effective-and-just-pretty&#34;&gt;What makes the difference between pretty effective and just pretty?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use aesthetics to help convey the message in our content. That’s why the study of design is often called ‘Visual Communication.’ Communicating in a visual way aims to create media that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;draws people into the content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assists people in understanding content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encourages people to respond to content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We achieve these goals by applying typography, colour, layout and form in a way that represents the meaning of the content, makes it easy to understand, and makes it easy to interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to find design that fails in these goals. There’s a lot of stuff out there that looks good at a glance, and at drawing you in, but is impossible to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;anti-accessibility-aesthetic-trends&#34;&gt;Anti-accessibility aesthetic trends&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a deliberately inflammatory title… I had a look at what the gallery websites reckon were the trends of the last four years. A disclaimer comes here as I don’t think anyone using these trends sets out to make their sites inaccessible. The examples following may well be incredibly accessible. These examples are just to show how these trends could compromise usability in favour of looking sexy and fashionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.035.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4695&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2012-was-the-year-of-the-grid-system&#34;&gt;2012 was the year of the grid system&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With responsive design becoming the rage, grid systems were abound in 2012. Frameworks popped up everywhere. Some frameworks, used responsibly, were great, making responsive layouts and prototyping very easy. However, most frameworks resulted in &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lt;div&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lt;span&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; soup when developers used them without any customisation or care for accessibility. There wasn’t a meaningful HTML element in sight…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.037.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4696&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.037.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshots of lots of grid frameworks&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2012 also heralded image carousels, back then still referred to as “sliders.” Designers could now cram extra content on to the page through the wonder of jQuery and other scripts. Unfortunately, the accessibility of the content, and the controls that helped you stop, advance, and rewind the content whizzing before your eyes, was not usually a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.040.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4697&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.040.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;2013&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2013-was-the-year-of-parallax&#34;&gt;2013 was the Year of Parallax&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scrolling with combined static and moving layers was the done thing. Rich content and storytelling made for compelling experiences, but also image-heavy pages that hijacked input conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.042.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4698&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2013 was also the year flat design started becoming “a thing.” Textures and images lost favour as responsive design meant the elements on our pages needed to be flexible. ‘Flat Design’ with its solid blocks of colour could be created easily with CSS, load quickly, and expand and collapse to fit the viewport size with no loss of quality. This meant it was also the year designers learned how to spell new words as they endlessly argued the merits of flat design vs &lt;strong&gt;skeuomorphism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.044.jpg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.045.jpg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2014-year-of-the-video-background&#34;&gt;2014, Year of the Video Background&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video backgrounds became big in 2014. I’m not even sure why, as these videos probably only ran smoothly on the large desktop screens of the designers working at mega corporations with extra speedy fibre-optic internet connections. The rest of us have to put up with slow, choppy and pixelated videos making the layouts distracting, and making it hard to read the text overlaid on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.047.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4701&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking around at sites that predict and analyse the trends so far for 2015, there’s not much that’s new out there. A few sites have mentioned simplicity becoming a trend, and as long as that doesn’t just mean hiding stuff, that may be a good thing. It might mean that web design is finally growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;constraints&#34;&gt;Constraints&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see from the trends how much designers crave constraint. Fashion is a constraint. It’s much easier to come up with a design when you know what you have to do in order to be “cool” or “modern.” Charles Eames said that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Design depends largely on constraints.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.050.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4702&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a designer working in furniture, architecture, film, art, graphic and industrial design, Charles Eames understood that constraints affect design no matter the discipline. A designer’s work is to respond to requirements or aims set by others or ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the web, constraints come in all different forms, some bigger than others. There are some overarching constraints that affect every project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-constraints&#34;&gt;Project constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each project comes with its own unique constraints dependent on its owners and their goals. A typical example of a project constraint might be existing brand guidelines. You have a particular logo, colour palette, tone of voice, and typographic system that has to be used on the project, and every other decision has to work around those constraints. You might have an existing content management system that dictates the framework and language you can use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;medium-technology-constraints&#34;&gt;Medium/technology constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we communicate in print, paper and ink is expensive. Newspapers look the way they do because we had to try to fit lots of text into tight columns on a few sheets of paper. When we communicate on the web, we avoid using massive images on every page because bandwidth is expensive. We compress our images, and try to optimise their appearance on different screen sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;audience-constraints&#34;&gt;Audience constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audience constraints can also be seen as constraints through convention. They’re are certain ways we approach the web based on the activity and expectations of our audience. Why don’t more websites use horizontal scrolling? Because a lot of people don’t know how to scroll horizontally, so they might miss important content. Search boxes are usually in the top right of the page because people started doing it, and then so many people were doing it that we came to expect search boxes on the top right of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;time-constraints&#34;&gt;Time constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is one of the most obvious constraints we have when working on a project. Even if we’re working on a constantly-evolving publishing project, there will be sub-projects within it. Such as articles and updates, that will be subject to a time frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;budget-constraints&#34;&gt;Budget constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Budget and time combined forms the strongest constraints. As these constraints will constrain everything else within a project. Budget will put constraints on time, and time tends to push the limits of budget. This is why budget and time are often used as reasons to avoid accessibility. “We don’t have enough time to make our site accessible,” or “we don’t have enough money to make our site accessible” are two of the most common excuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these excuses aren’t good enough. I probably don’t need to explain the value of making a site accessible. There’s some truth in a little more budget and time being needed for accessibility; whether it’s through training, research, testing, or additional design and development time. But no more than is needed for the consideration of these other core constraints. Nobody would ever say that there wasn’t time or money enough to consider web performance as a constraint. The expense of not considering web performance is far too high. What we need to convey to people is that not considering accessibility is also expensive. It costs a huge amount in lost audience, and a lack of usability for the remaining audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think accessibility belongs on this list as a core constraint that we consider as part of every project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project constraints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medium/technology constraints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audience constraints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time constraints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budget constraints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility constraints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, it could be a sub-set of audience constraints, but including it in that way could lead to the misunderstanding that people with accessibility needs are a sub-set of the overall audience, rather than looking at it from a universal design—everybody benefits from accessibility—approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;designers-understand-constraints&#34;&gt;Designers understand constraints&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we’re trying to convince designers to work with accessibility as a constraint, it shouldn’t be so difficult. Designers are used to working with much smaller and more specific constraints in the field of aesthetic design. When designers are learning their practice, they learn rules about typography, colour, layout, and form; and only once they understand these constraints, they learn how they can break out of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s look at the four pillars of aesthetic design, and the constraints therein:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aesthetic-design-and-the-accessibility-constraints&#34;&gt;Aesthetic design and the accessibility constraints&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;typography&#34;&gt;Typography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look at web typography from an aesthetic point of view, we have two major areas to consider: the technical and the practical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;technical-typography&#34;&gt;Technical typography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical part of web typography is considering how a font might look applied straight to text without any interference/fancy CSS typesetting, or any control over it whatsoever. Because this is what we work with on a basic level without JavaScript or the CSS that only works on a few platforms. We also need to consider how it renders cross-browser. Looking at fonts through progressive enhancement and cross-browser consistency is definitely an accessible approach to typography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.066.jpg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;practical-typography&#34;&gt;Practical typography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s slightly less obvious when it comes to the practical part of web typography. In order to choose typefaces that work for our projects, we need to really understand what we want from a typeface, and what we aim to achieve through typography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to remember that typography exists to represent content, and so it’s always worthwhile to read the text before we design it. Our aim is to invite the reader in, and make the text appear easy to read, not an intimidating mass. Typography should also reveal the meaning of the text. Comic Sans isn’t appropriate for a formal restaurant site, and a swirling script typeface isn’t appropriate for the website of a party clown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.070.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4705&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.070.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A paragraph set in Blackoak Std, and a paragraph set in Heinemann&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Blackoak Std makes for chunky intimidating body text, Heinemann makes for a more inviting paragraph.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we read through the text, we can understand where it needs special treatment: where does the structure and order need to be made clear? The connections and differences between elements should be shown. The visual relationships between the text and other elements should reflect their real relationship. A heading is more important than a paragraph, and its importance should be revealed through size differences at the very least. All of these factors can be combined together to induce an ideal state for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.073.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4706&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.073.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A paragraph with larger and smaller headings&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Clear headings, links, and typographic hierarchy.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest win in accessible typography is just getting the text at a readable size. The most readable typeface is unreadable at a small size, yet so many sizes squeeze tiny text so they can fit more into a layout. Responsive design should have made it more obvious that scrolling is perfectly acceptable. The smaller the x-height (the height of a lowercase x), the bigger your text will need to be in order to be readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.071.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4707&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.071.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Different sized paragraphs at 10px, 12px, 18px and 24px&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;readability&#34;&gt;Readability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst good structure and a strong differentiation between elements will help a reader understand how to read the text, the key to accessible typography is in choosing a readable font.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniform texture is more important than the shapes of the individual characters in a typeface. Typography isn’t the same as logo design. When we look at the relationship between the letters, an even texture helps our eyes flow over the text, not getting caught up on unexpected spaces and distracting shapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.077.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4708&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.077.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Paragraphs of uniform and uneven texture&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		If you squint at the top paragraph, it has an even texture. If you squint at the lower paragraph, it’s a much more blobby, uneven texture.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since high resolution displays became the designers’ favourite, thin text is all the rage. Apple did it, and now everybody else does too. But so often thin text is just too thin, making the text appear very light against the background, making it harder to read. Heavy text also doesn’t provide enough contrast between the text and the background, as its chunkiness makes it hard to distinguish letterforms. You want to choose the Goldilocks of typeface weights: not too heavy, not too light. A high contrast of crisp letterforms with enough space around and between the shapes will make text much easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.078.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4709&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.078.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Light and heavy paragraphs of text&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lines of each letterform also need attention. Serif fonts, in particular, often contrast thick and thin lines within one letter. Your eyes are naturally drawn to the thick lines, and less to the thin, which creates an uneven and distracting texture, making it harder to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.079.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4710&#34;&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		High-contrast serif
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also want to avoid complex details in the letterforms. The loops in Giddyup Std are cute, but overcrowd body text too much. You can see how our reading would be disrupted and tripped up by a loop or a curl in an unusual place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.080.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4711&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature of letterforms that affects the readability of a typeface is the counters. These are the spaces inside the letters. Sometimes they’re open, like Cs, and sometimes they’re closed, like Os. We need a clear distinction between the open and closed counters, so you can easily tell them apart. Otherwise a phrase like Rococo Cocoon could easily be misread as Rooooo Ooooon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.081.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4712&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.081.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Embrionic has very closed counters, Museo Sans has more open counters&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some typefaces are specifically designed to be easier for people with cognitive difficulties. Heinemann is a beautiful typeface designed in-house at Heinemann educational publishing for young readers. The ascenders and descenders (the parts of the letters that ascend above the lowercase letters, and the parts that descend below the lowercase letters) are emphasised to make it easier for readers to distinguish between letters. The letterforms such as lowercase a and g are drawn in the same shape as we learn to write by hand, to make them more recognisable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-heinemann/heinemann/gallery.html&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4713&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.083.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Heinemann type family&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many designers look down on Comic Sans, it shares those same early-learner letterforms as Heinemann, and is often favoured by teachers in classrooms as the letterforms are the same as those the children are using when they’re learning to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/comic-sans/&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4714&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read Regular, Dyslexie and Open Dyslexic are both fonts designed with dyslexic readers in mind, but with very different approaches. Read Regular is more similar to Heinemann in that it takes a sans serif style, and simple letterforms to assist in readability. However Dyslexie and Open Dyslexic take a very different approach, with noticeably heavier sections around the baseline to prevent readers from accidentally reading the letters upside down (a common issue in dyslexia.) The counters have been opened up, and similar looking letters (such as n and m, or vwy), have been adjusted in shape and height so they look different, and are easier to tell apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;colour&#34;&gt;Colour&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-we-interact-with-colour&#34;&gt;How we interact with colour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we’re designing for the web, we tend interact with colour via colour pickers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.088.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4717&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.088.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Colour pickers&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Colour wheel (left) is a more classic layout, with blended hues in a ring. The colour spectrum on the right is more recognisable as it takes the blends you see in the colour wheel, and adds white and black to give you varying shades. The bars in the middle are usually sliders, and allow you to slide between different hues, saturation and brightness for your chosen colour.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of using hues visualised on a colour wheel is that you’re more likely to find colours that work well in a palette. You can pick from side-by-side colours for an analogous blend, or from colours opposite each other on the wheel for a more striking colour contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.096.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4718&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.096.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Colour picking with droppers on opposite sides of the colour wheel&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Colour picking from opposite sides of the colour wheel
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the accessibility of colour is more than just picking two different colours. In order to make our foreground text readable against our background colour, we need &lt;strong&gt;contrast&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we’re trying to find a good contrast, the colour wheel isn’t much help. The key is the sliders for brightness and saturation. A high contrast is caused by a greater difference the foreground and background brightness, and the foreground and background saturation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.105.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4719&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.105.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Varying the brightness for colour contrast&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Varying the brightness for colour contrast
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a blue background with blue text of a similar lightness will be hard to read, whereas a lighter blue against a darker blue is much easier, making a more accessible foreground-background contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.106.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4720&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.106.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Different strengths of saturation, with greater difference comes higher contrast&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Varying the saturation for colour contrast
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same applies to saturation. Deeply saturated yellow text will have a low contrast against a similarly deeply saturated yellow. However, using a desaturated yellow in the background makes for a more accessible foreground-background contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.107.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4721&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.107.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;High contrast with different colours, but the same contrast between brightness and saturation as before&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Using the different colour pairs with the same brightness and saturation as before
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same rules apply even when you’re using different colours for the foreground and background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very high contrast foreground and background combinations can also suffer from accessibility problems. Issues with high contrast aren’t talked about as often, but can hurt your eyes, and be particularly problematic for people with dyslexia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.108.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4722&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid screaming high contrast, I would recommend softening the difference between the foreground and background values slightly, bringing one value slightly closer to the other. By tweaking these contrasts slightly, they’re much easier on the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.109.jpg&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we considered accessibility at a brand level, what would that be like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we designed our logos and associated colour palettes with an accessible colour contrast in mind? I’ve been doing this for years, not really thinking much of it. As a designer who usually created a logo and would then go on to design and develop a site around it, it just made sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.111.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4724&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.111.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Logo designs with accessible text colours&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Some of my old logo designs
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we make the colours accessible, then the colours we use on the site can be consistently on-brand later on; we won’t suddenly need to use a darker colour for our body text because our brand’s colour palette produces unreadable results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.113.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4725&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.113.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Early typography-based logo designs&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Some early designs for logos, with accessible, web-compatible typography
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we choose our logo and brand typefaces with readability and web typography in mind, not just which typeface has three letters that look good for our logo? Maybe if our logo is a swirling script face, we should consider a complementary body text early on, when we’re designing the rest of our brand. This could prevent us getting caught out when our site designer or developer has to pick a completely off-brand typeface because our brand typography is so hard to read as body text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.114.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4726&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.114.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A script based logo with an upright sans serif body text. They don’t quite work together.&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		A beautiful script logo and beautiful web typography, but the brand doesn’t quite match up.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earlier we, as designers, learn to consider accessibility, the less likely we’ll have our designs diluted and confused further down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;strategies-for-involving-accessibility-from-the-beginning-of-the-design-process&#34;&gt;Strategies for involving accessibility from the beginning of the design process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have a few simple strategies for involving accessibility from the beginning of the design process…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;understanding-accessibility&#34;&gt;Understanding accessibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just understanding why it’s worth making our sites accessible is a big first step. Only the most foolish people would learn a little about accessibility and not hold it in their heads for every future project. I don’t mean having to become an expert overnight, but just knowing little tips and tricks to make sites better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;constraints-1&#34;&gt;Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering accessibility as a constraint is a complementary to the other strategies. It’s a more specific way of thinking, as you’re always referring back to accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sitting-in-on-testing-and-focus-groups&#34;&gt;Sitting in on testing and focus groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we hear and witness the experiences of others, it’s much easier to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) understand how other people don’t interact with the web in the same way we do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) understand the multitude of ways people CAN interact with the web and how we might better serve their needs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;being-involved-in-human-research&#34;&gt;Being involved in human research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being involved in human research is very similar to the previous point, but is more about being ahead of the work, rather than behind it. We need to be researching and understanding human interaction before we start a single task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we’re only discovering issues with accessibility in a later testing phase, we’re already behind the curve.&lt;/p&gt;
In the talk I gave this morning, I then went on to talk about the 3 Rs of Ethical Design. But rather than explain it to you here, I think you should &lt;a href=&#34;https://ind.ie/you-are-the-product/&#34;&gt;watch Aral cover it in his talk Beyond The Camera Panopticon: You Are The Product&lt;/a&gt; (the part on Ethical Design starts at around the 53 minute mark.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-accessibility-more-accessible&#34;&gt;Make accessibility more accessible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to make accessibility more accessible to different roles in our organisations, we need to learn how to better incorporate it into our existing processes. Acknowledging accessibility as a constraint from the outset ensures we have it as a point of reference at every step in the process. This also deliberately avoids looking at accessibility as some kind of checklist. Designers need to understand that accessibility can no more be ticked off a list than user experience can. These aren’t checklist tasks, but are our goals, our focuses, and our approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/Accessibility-By-Design.132.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4727&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that was my talk. Some of these thoughts are more developed than others. If you have any comments or want to discuss these things further, I’d love to hear what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A realign for 2015</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/a-realign-for-2015/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2015 17:24:04 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/a-realign-for-2015/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Almost a year after &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/a-little-realign/&#34; title=&#34;A little realign&#34;&gt;last year’s realign&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve made some more tweaks to my site. There were a few reasons behind it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m not freelance anymore, so I don’t need the focus on my portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I’m now working with Ind.ie, I needed to update my about page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The navigation needed some accessibility work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The colours were beginning to grate on me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;less-portfolio-more&#34;&gt;Less portfolio, more…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My blog has been fairly quiet, but actually that’s because I’ve been writing a lot elsewhere. I write a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ind.ie/blog/roundup-15-03-27/&#34;&gt;weekly roundup on the Ind.ie site every week&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://alistapart.com/author/laurakalbag&#34;&gt;regular column on A List Apart&lt;/a&gt;. I want to keep up with linking back to this new content, and keep writing more blog posts specifically on this site. As the portfolio isn’t needed so much, as I’m not looking for clients, it doesn’t need as much focus, so I’ve moved latest posts to a more prominent position on the homepage. However, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to keep up with the project case studies. They’re fun to share, and help me remember what I’ve done. I’ve got a big backlog going back at least a year, but I will get those projects up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/04/old-homepage.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-large wp-image-4636&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/04/old-homepage-812x1024.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of the old laurakalbag.wpengine.com homepage&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Old homepage with big portfolio, loud colours, and the ill-fitting Ind.ie banner (now the Ind.ie logo is more subtly in the header)
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/04/new-homepage.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-large wp-image-4635&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/04/new-homepage-694x1024.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of laurakalbag.wpengine.com homepage&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		New homepage with blog posts, smaller portfolio and different colour mix
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;less-about-me&#34;&gt;Less about me…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site previously had loads of “about” content. There was a ordinary about page, then my skills, who I work with, what I do, and separate pages detailing my main areas of work. These are all now streamlined and redirected into a properly up-to-date &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/about-me/&#34; title=&#34;About Me&#34;&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;navigation-accessibility&#34;&gt;Navigation accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve been getting my head around &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.opera.com/articles/introduction-to-wai-aria/&#34;&gt;WAI-ARIA&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a very valuable way to help make more modern interactive elements of your site accessible to assistive devices. This was massively helped by the wonder Heydon Pickering, who sent me this tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;[@laurakalbag](https://twitter.com/laurakalbag) Hey Laura. Know you’re big on [#a11y](https://twitter.com/hashtag/a11y?src=hash), so thought you may want to try [http://t.co/iiYoaLRYbp](http://t.co/iiYoaLRYbp) to fix your site’s dropdown.

— Hayden StandardAware (@heydonworks) [November 14, 2014](https://twitter.com/heydonworks/status/533171711030882304)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just ashamed that it took me so long to get around to it. Now, thanks to Heydon’s fantastic rundown of &lt;a href=&#34;http://heydonworks.com/practical_aria_examples/#progressive-collapsibles&#34;&gt;Practical Aria Examples&lt;/a&gt;, I’m using &lt;code&gt;aria-controls&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;aria-hidden&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;aria-expanded&lt;/code&gt; to great effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/04/menu.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4637&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/04/menu.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of page navigation expanded under the Menu button&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-colours&#34;&gt;The colours&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love my brightly coloured site, and the custom colours for different pages, posts and projects. I’ve used Advanced Custom Fields to set up colour pickers for the WordPress page and post editors, so I just have to choose a colour every time I publish. The colours are pulled in via PHP, on top of my general styles, into the CSS in the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; of each page. My pickers look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-02-at-17.55.30.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption alignleft size-large wp-image-4634&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-02-at-17.55.30-479x1024.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of four colour picking areas&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		The colour picker in the WordPress post editor
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous design of the site, I used brightly coloured backgrounds with white text. However, this was getting a little bit dicey with readability. While I made sure the colour combinations had a contrast that was &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; accessible, I’d often go back to a post a few days later and shudder at my appalling colour choices. I needed to ease off the colour and go a little bit cleaner. However, I had picked a colour palette for every page, post and project on my site &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; when I’d &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/really-a-redesign-this-cant-be-real/&#34; title=&#34;Really, a redesign? This can’t be real…&#34;&gt;redesigned in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. It’d be a shame to waste all that effort. I decided to just switch some of the colour palette choices around, so the background was a simpler easy-on-the-eyes grey, and the text would take on the colour. Suddenly the site felt a lot less oppressive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a lesson in semantic naming that day. Unfortunately, if you rename a field in Advanced Custom Fields, it wipes out the entries in the database for that field, so I’m stuck with my original palette names such as “header colour” for the colour of the text. Hopefully the colours match up fairly well, as the contrast hasn’t changed much, but please let me know if you find a page that’s hard to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-tweaks&#34;&gt;Other tweaks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other little fixes and changes I’ve made after having them on my list for ages. Fixing block quote styles, footer layout on certain viewport widths, mismatch of font sizes before and after web font loading, dodgy search box layout and ensuring I’m not loading the web font loader from Google anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ssl-hoorah&#34;&gt;SSL hoorah!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the final thing is that this site now works at &lt;strong&gt;https&lt;/strong&gt;://laurakalbag.wpengine.com. That’s thanks to WP Engine for enabling SSL as an option on their personal accounts, making it as easy as me pressing a button and paying a little bit of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this site is now a little easier to read, and way more up-to-date. I like to think it’s a little bit more grown-up. Any further suggestions always gratefully received!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week &lt;a href=&#34;http://alistapart.com/column/breaking-stuff&#34;&gt;my latest column, Breaking Stuff&lt;/a&gt;, was published on A List Apart. I’m in a strange transitional period, moving from client work to fulltime at &lt;a href=&#34;https://ind.ie&#34;&gt;ind.ie&lt;/a&gt;, so I think I’ll be writing more about situations like these as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also finally updated that terrible avatar to something much better. I look uncharacteristically pale, but at least I’m normal colours! (Unlike the last terrible photo I’d used.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/i-dont-like-it-on-a-list-apart/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Heh. That’s a misleading title! I’ve been on holiday, so I’m late to posting this update. Just over a week ago, &lt;a href=&#34;http://alistapart.com/column/i-dont-like-it&#34;&gt;my most recent column, I Don’t Like It&lt;/a&gt;, was posted on A List Apart. I’d heard some designers discussing their clients in less-than-favourable terms. This kind of behaviour makes me cross. It’s the &lt;a href=&#34;http://clientsfromhell.net/&#34;&gt;Clients From Hell&lt;/a&gt; attitude that poor communication is a client’s fault, when &lt;a href=&#34;http://alistapart.com/column/good-designers-good-clients&#34; title=&#34;Column on Good Designers, Good Clients&#34;&gt;it’s more often a designer’s fault&lt;/a&gt;. It might be easier to talk about these situations in the abstract than give solid advice on how to behave better. So I gave it a try, with some example interactions in my column.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today &lt;a href=&#34;http://alistapart.com/column/me-and-my-big-fat-ego&#34;&gt;my column on Me and My Big Fat Ego&lt;/a&gt; was published on A List Apart. It’s not that I’d say I have a huge ego, but it’s definitely something that’s easily bruised when I feel like things aren’t going my way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Speaking at WXG 2014 in Guildford</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m speaking at &lt;a href=&#34;http://wxg.co.uk/#speakers&#34;&gt;WXG 2014 in Guildford&lt;/a&gt; in September. This is exciting for me because I attended the first ever WXG a couple of years ago, and it’s about as local as a conference is going to get to my hometown, Reigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/wxg-2014-tickets-9070836115&#34;&gt;tickets&lt;/a&gt; are a bargain at just £69 for early birds, and there’s already a great lineup with still more to be announced…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to talk about how we design the web. These days, “web designer” is used to describe all sorts of jobs and people. I’m going to discuss what we really create when we design for the web, where our responsibilities and loyalties lie, and how we hone our design skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicklas Persson and Cole Peters are also speaking so I’m really chuffed to be part of a great lineup!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Heart Internet posted &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.heartinternet.co.uk/blog/article/interview-with-web-accessibility-champion-laura-kalbag&#34;&gt;an interview with me&lt;/a&gt; on their site. They start off saying some very kind things about me, and then it covers accessibility, design, speaking at conferences and a bit of client work. As a bonus, it’s interspersed with photos of me pulling weird faces at conferences (and being business on the phone!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Design theory for the web, a workshop</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/design-theory-for-the-web-workshop/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a slightly scary thing: I’m doing &lt;a href=&#34;http://makedo.in/design-theory-for-the-web/&#34;&gt;my first solo workshop on the 11th October 2013 in Barnsley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often get asked about the best way to “learn design”, and I usually say that you learn by doing and you learn by watching how others do it. In this workshop, I want to give new designers, developers, and anybody else wanting to learn how to design for the web, a good foundation with five primers, a bit of doing and a bit of watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a low-cost workshop. The early bird tickets are just £125, and the full-price tickets are just £165. Fancy joining me for the day? &lt;a href=&#34;http://makedo.in/design-theory-for-the-web/#nav-register&#34;&gt;Grab a ticket from the makedo site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        Good luck on your first solo workshop, although I’m sure you’ll be great at it.

One thing, how suitable is this for a developer who’s looking to understand more about design? I don’t have much of a design background at all, mostly a server-side developer.

It’s absolutely aimed at developers and beginners who are new to designing for the web. More experienced designers might pick up some tips and tricks, but my main focus is the beginners.

      <title>Fl&amp;#42;t design trend</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/flat-design-trend/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2013 14:41:59 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/flat-design-trend/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I’m about to apply a mute filter to the word “flat” on Twitter. That or start unfollowing &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-s-flat&#34;&gt;What’s flat?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an aesthetic “trend” that’s been around for a while. It involves fewer gradients and textures and has thus been described as “flat” design. It’s often described as the opposite of “&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph&#34;&gt;skeuomorphism&lt;/a&gt;,” (which is an equally irritating word when used in this way.) It was popularised by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language)&#34;&gt;Windows Metro&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and, being an aesthetic associated with fewer images, and thus better performance and more flexibility in the development of interfaces, has been a feature of many designs in both apps and on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;design-described-as-an-aesthetic-summary&#34;&gt;Design described as an aesthetic summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aesthetics are just one facet of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Something may be pretty, but a horrible user experience. Something may be pretty, but completely inappropriate for the audience or the business. Every decision made in the process of creating a product is by design. There is so much complexity to design, and to judge an interactive design purely on an aesthetic basis is simply superficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;trends&#34;&gt;Trends&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trends are fine, and inevitable. Designers are inspired by each other, particularly the more effective solutions to common problems, and consequently some work ends up &lt;em&gt;looking&lt;/em&gt; much like other work. However, to dismiss work that is aesthetically similar as part of a trend is often insulting to the role of a designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, many (charlatan) designers will simply reapply an aesthetic to the content they’ve been given and call it “design” without questioning whether it’s appropriate for the content or easy to use in its behaviour. But true designers do not just assign aesthetic styles to content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a decision and a reason behind choosing that aesthetic. It will be used as a design language to communicate to the user how to interact with the product. It will be affected by, and have implications for, the use of the product and the build process. A million tiny decisions will have been made to come to that aesthetic conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m sure that decisions made by 99.99% of designers will not have been “I’ll use the flat design trend.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&#34;opacity: .8;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;opacity: .8;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was inspired by the many people on Twitter criticising Apple for “following the flat design trend” (and the many variants on that comment) with their iOS7 interface design. I’m trying not to be snotty when I say this, but I’m reserving judgement until I’ve had a device running iOS7 in my hands for a few days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;opacity: .8;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aral wrote a very good post on “&lt;a href=&#34;http://aralbalkan.com/notes/design-is-not-veneer/&#34;&gt;Design is not veneer&lt;/a&gt;” which explores this topic in more depth and is well-worth a read.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;comment-entry&#34;&gt;
        I’ve found the whole debacle really funny.  Dribbble seems to house many designers that believe their opinion is higher than that of Apple themselves. Give it a few months and they’ll be knocking out icons just like Mr Ive whilst sipping on their skinny latte.

Bugger them all, I just plan to do stuff my way.
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;comment-entry&#34;&gt;
        My initial reaction is that I don’t like the icons or the colour palette. However, Im also aware I’m looking at the design ‘blind’ and that this direction has been taken due the UX and new features that have been put in.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        I get more irritated by the fact Apple’s website still isn’t responsive, because, you know pinch and zoom is all you need &amp;#8230;

Anyway come October there will no doubt be lots of praise for the new iOS7 shiny.

Funny how people love the new but hate change.

Ho hum

        &lt;p&gt;It is nice to see designers putting things in context like you are doing here.

Somewhere along the line the idea that flat is better or even the correct way to design established a critical mass. Many designers seem to be adopting it without much questioning.

Careful, do not drink the Kool-Aid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

        I guess the world that revolves around Dribbble has kind of spoiled me when it comes to design. I see all these great works — many of which do follow trends, but also great unique ones — so I expect something mind-blowing from Apple. While the fl*t design in the apps look nice, those home screen icons (mainly Safari and Mail) simply look rushed and condensed. Their design gives the impression that they were changing the look for the sake of “de-Forstall-ing” iOS and getting it ready in time for WWDC, not because it’s truly a better experience. 

Honestly (and I’ll probably be shunned for saying this), the new Weather app is a great example of an excellent design with a pleasant experience. It’s simple, can be used easily, makes sense, and just begs to be used for its visuals. And those backgrounds make them not entirely fl*t in design! ;)
    &lt;/div&gt;

        It’s a tough one, Responsive Design is probably in the same sort of category, I’ve written in the past about how “responsive design” is made up of so many little micro design decisions that vary between implementations that it is ok to use the term even though it isn’t always used the way a purist may want it to be used (completely fluid layouts). In this light flat design has to be seen not as a comment on a design style but a set of design practices that culminate in an end product that resides in the aesthetic group we would call “flat design”.

I guess the problem with the prevalence of the “flat design” trend as a meme (which, let’s face it, is really what this is&amp;#8230;right?) is that it creates an atmosphere that draws an illusionary line between modern professional practice and out dated or unprofessional practice.

The use of the term flat design throughout our literature, magazines are big culprits when it comes to this, actually causes our industry harm. Even if people don’t think they’re doing it, there is a whole ethos that a certain “type” of design is the way things must look, otherwise you are just “not doing it right”. 

I don’t mind people using the term flat design so much as *how* or *why* they use it, I guess is what I’m trying to say.

The whole nonsense with iOS7 is quite funny in this respect because despite any of my personal opinions about it, if Metro was what spawned flat design then iOS7 is by no means a “flat design” solution. The UI world is not either skeumorphic or flat, as you say! If we want to attach a label then one that has been used among plenty of 3rd party android developers over the last couple of years for their UI apps seems more apt and semantically accurate&amp;#8230; minimalistic design.

        Talking in very general terms, I prefer an uncluttered interface that uses design elements (gradients, drop-shadow, text-shadow) sparingly.

Just because you have the ability to do something, doesn’t mean you have to. Design in its simplest form (usually) lends itself to uncomplicated user interfaces that are easy to use. Using simple blocks of tonal colour (like your site) looks nice, its simplistic but it lends itself to faster loading times, which always helps.

I’ve seen the iOS 7 interface and icons and whilst I like some aspects of the update I really don’t like some of their new icons. I think Apple lost their innovation with the death of Steve Jobs and now they’re copying what others are doing –; and that will only end in Apple losing everything that made them great.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Yes! You are totally right.

We have absolutely no idea how the designers at Apple got to their design decisions, so to simply dismiss this to following a trend is wrong is so many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also one of the things I dislike about show-pretty-picture-sites like Dribbble.

Often we get no background information on the why and how for a design. No idea about the client it’s made for (if any client is involved in the first place), the brief or what so ever.&lt;/p&gt;
Like Aral wrote in his post, we can’t stress enough that design isn’t about pretty pictures. It’s about all things involved in a service or product.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        I think Flat is a bullshit term. It’s not a new thing, and I’m sick of it being seen as such. Metro is typography based, but inspired by the use of Type and Grids by the Swiss (if you’re a designer and have no idea on the Swiss Style, you REALLY need to be educated about this stuff), which was simple, and minimal. Flat is nothing more than that. The fact it has that word as if it’s a new thing really annoys me.

If you’re going &lt;strike&gt;flat&lt;/strike&gt; **minimal**, at least do it well, and put it good practice. I’m tired of everything “needing” to be flat, let alone the atheistic being more important than the objective. &lt;strike&gt;Fuck&lt;/strike&gt; the flat police.

        A great post, Laura, and one that I have been considering myself, and for the same reasons.

Far too many think that a few minutes of subjection to videos of a user interface (of iOS7) qualifies them to over rule many months of painstaking design decisions that Apple have made over the last year or so, most of which will probably go totally un-noticed. Frankly it’s embarrassing to hear these people call themselves designers.

Everyone’s a critic when it comes to the visual elements of design but, as you mention above, that is only one small part of the whole.

Thanks for sharing, Laura.

Steve

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Design Feast have my answers to their Designer’s Quest(ionnaire) on their site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scroll past the scarily large photo of me quickly… their questions prompted me to think about some interesting points, especially challenges for designers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of the challenges you encounter as a designer and how do you deal with them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the greatest challenge a designer comes across is their own ego. It’s in our nature, as those that deal in creativity, we have egos that allow us to consider our work good enough to share, and good enough for clients to pay us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, too much ego and we’d never iterate past our first draft of any design work, we’d never pay attention to client requirements, and we’d never allow anyone to tell us if we’re wrong. In my experience, my best work has been done when I’ve set my ego aside and worked collaboratively with clients and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Every now and again someone will email me asking how they should go about learning design. After reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://aralbalkan.com/notes/design-is-not-veneer/&#34;&gt;Aral Balkan’s fantastic post&lt;/a&gt; on how design is not veneer, a few developers also expressed frustration at there not being many resources telling you how to get started with design. So I thought I’d post a few of my favourite links, books and ways of approaching design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, read &lt;a href=&#34;http://aralbalkan.com/notes/design-is-not-veneer/&#34;&gt;Aral’s post&lt;/a&gt;. It might seem intimidating. Aral emphasises the importance of considering every tiny design decision you make. There’s no easy-in. But really there’s no easy-in to doing anything well. Development might appear to be something with a low barrier to entry, but in order to do development with web standards, or to any level of efficiency, you need to take the time to learn the best techniques and working processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering every tiny design decision might also make design seem like a much more arduous process than it needs to be. In truth, if you are considering your users, their experience, and your overall design vision in the back of your mind, every decision you make whilst designing will be considered. It can feel somewhat subconscious at times. If you have the ‘feeling’ that your choice of typography suits the project, then chances are, if you analyse the cognitive and emotional impact on the user, you’ll find your subconscious actually made those decisions for a reason. Design isn’t instinct. This ‘instinct’ is really something that we’ve built up from the experience of millions of different design decisions, and evaluating their success and failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning-how-to-design&#34;&gt;Learning &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design is a pretty tricky thing to just ‘learn’; it doesn’t happen overnight. Following a tutorial on how to create a photo-realistic SLR camera in Photoshop is about as useful as following a tutorial on how to create an SLR camera in CSS; it teaches you how to use the tools but not about why you’d want to use an SLR camera illustration in your design. The best thing is to try as many different design tasks as possible to test yourself and gain experience on what does and doesn’t work. I also find looking at other people’s design work and considering its effectiveness really helps develop an understanding of design principles in relation to your own personal taste. This is what a lot of art and design education is built around; interpreting and understanding the work of other people. Blog posts where people tell you about their inspiration and how they designed their sites are the best sources for this kind of learning as you get real insight into the decisions of the designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opposite of this are sites that showcase trends, ‘beautiful’ websites or lists of a particular type of site as ‘inspiration.’ These tend to be examples of what are very aesthetically-pleasing designs, but not necessarily successful designs in terms of a good user experience. Of course convention can be a trend of sorts. If one designer establishes a really easy-to-use type of navigation, then it’s inevitable that those working on similar projects may use that standard as a basis for their own navigation, but only &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt; projects. It’s so easy to mimic a lovely visual aesthetic to make your project look good, but you really need to consider if that’s an &lt;em&gt;appropriate&lt;/em&gt; aesthetic style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;blogs&#34;&gt;Blogs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog-wise, I prefer the more ideasy and critical thinking blogs, as I find ‘how to design xyz’ is never terribly useful unless you’re working on an identical project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-list-apart-design-category-http-www-alistapart-com-topics-design&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alistapart.com/topics/design/&#34;&gt;A List Apart design category&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few magazine sites curate design content so well. It’s all too easy to fall into posts that are just lists of ‘inspiration.’ A List Apart is one of the most tightly-curated and edited magazines around, and their design articles are always worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;paul-robert-lloyd-http-www-paulrobertlloyd-com-journal&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paulrobertlloyd.com/journal/&#34;&gt;Paul Robert Lloyd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to learn more about design thinking, especially a focus on how responsiveness fits into design, Paul Robert Lloyd’s posts are must-reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;usabilitypost-http-www-usabilitypost-com&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usabilitypost.com/&#34;&gt;UsabilityPost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very insightful blog focused on usability, often discussing design in terms of successful user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;sidebar-io-http-sidebar-io&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://sidebar.io/&#34;&gt;Sidebar.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidebar.io is crowd-sourced by a select group, so has a slightly curated more zeitgeist-y feel to it. The links aren’t always long-form articles on design, but if there’s a good post going around, they’ll pick up on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;mark-boulton-http-www-markboulton-co-uk-journal&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal&#34;&gt;Mark Boulton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark has always been talking about more traditional design theory as a part of web design, and his approach has always inspired me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;people&#34;&gt;People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is a great way to keep up with good designers. I find these snippets of insight can often provide bite-size inspiration when I really need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;books&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m always disappointed that there aren’t more design theory books with a focus on web design. The few I’ve found are here, but also books on usability and graphic design where you can combine the knowledge to create a great design background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-practical-guide-to-designing-the-invisible-by-robert-mills-http-www-fivesimplesteps-com-products-a-practical-guide-to-designing-the-invisible&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/a-practical-guide-to-designing-the-invisible&#34;&gt;A Practical Guide to Designing the Invisible by Robert Mills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding design as a language, and how design is more than just the visual decoration. &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/a-practical-guide-to-designing-the-invisible/&#34; title=&#34;A Practical Guide to Designing the invisible&#34;&gt;I’ve reviewed Rob’s book in more depth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-practical-guide-to-designing-for-the-web-by-mark-boulton-http-www-fivesimplesteps-com-products-a-practical-guide-to-designing-for-the-web&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/a-practical-guide-to-designing-for-the-web&#34;&gt;A Practical Guide to Designing for the Web by Mark Boulton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great grounding in many of the different areas of design theory in relation to the web. I’m very eagerly awaiting Mark’s next book on grid theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;ordering-disorder-grid-principles-for-web-design-by-khoi-vinh-http-grids-subtraction-com&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://grids.subtraction.com/&#34;&gt;Ordering Disorder: Grid Principles for Web Design by Khoi Vinh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-dating responsive design, but still a very valuable book for learning about applying grids to web design in a practical way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-elements-of-user-experience-by-jesse-james-garrett-http-www-jjg-net-elements&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jjg.net/elements/&#34;&gt;The Elements of User Experience by Jesse James Garrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An oldie but a goodie. These founding principles really molded the way I view design for the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;designing-for-emotion-by-aarron-walter-http-www-abookapart-com-products-designing-for-emotion&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion&#34;&gt;Designing for Emotion by Aarron Walter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering not just the user experience, but the user emotions. A quick but brilliant read which &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/designing-for-emotion/&#34; title=&#34;Designing For Emotion&#34;&gt;I’ve reviewed in more depth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;edit-how-could-i-forget-this-first-time-round-elements-of-typographic-style-by-robert-bringhurst-http-www-amazon-co-uk-elements-typographic-style-robert-bringhurst-dp-0881792063&#34;&gt;[Edit: How could I forget this first time round?!] &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063&#34;&gt;Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An incredibly in-depth guide to typography, giving you all the basic principles you need and more.[/edit]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;edit-2-8faces-magazine-http-8faces-com&#34;&gt;[Edit 2:] &lt;a href=&#34;http://8faces.com/&#34;&gt;8faces Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not quite a book, but a beautiful typography magazine with new releases a few times a year. 8faces introduces you to great quality typefaces and provides plenty of insight into design with its feature interviews.[/edit]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-ll-try-to-keep-them-coming&#34;&gt;I’ll try to keep them coming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources on learning design aren’t necessarily those I keep a lookout for, but I’m going to make a conscious effort to do so from now on. I’ll &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/laurakalbag&#34;&gt;post on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and maybe do a round-up post later on, so let me know if you know of any good resources I should check out.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hi Laura, Love what you’re doing here. I myself am a college student and I created [Student Guide Web Design](http://www.studentguidewebdesign.com&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow) simply out of frustration with the material I was being presented during my design education. I love helping others because it’s a great way for me to learn myself, but also helps others out who are also trying to overcome the same challenges (because I was there at one point!).

Cheers from Canada :)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Mobile First</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing on with my chapter-a-day, last week I finished reading the brilliant &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first&#34; title=&#34;Mobile First on A Book Apart&#34;&gt;Mobile First&lt;/a&gt; by Luke Wroblewski.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
Mobile design and development has gained momentum over the last few years; with responsive design and designers regularly going giddy over iPhone app UIs, it’s surprising how little the industry discusses the *design* issues. We seem to prefer to get caught up in the more technical and development-based conversations (or the infuriatingly dull native vs web, but I’ll get back to that!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke Wroblewski’s Mobile First makes for a refreshing change. Luke talks about *designing* for mobile experiences. He shares case studies and ideas behind UI design, including loads of concepts that had never even crossed my (admittedly slightly limited) mind. (&lt;em&gt;Should the navigation be moved to the bottom of the page on mobile screens so it doesn’t get in the way of the main page content?!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you work for a company or clients who are reluctant to consider mobile solutions, this book is perfect for you. Luke arms you with stats aplenty to back up why the mobile experience is a very current issue and the immense gains that can be had by paying attention to smaller screens. I’m lucky to work with clients who consider mobile as important as the desktop experience, but I still found these statistics valuable in reminding me why I bother!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a (perhaps-overly) frequent attendee of conferences, I’m sick of the “native vs web” debate (panel go-to question where the answer is always ‘it depends on the context!’) Fortunately, Luke is very much agnostic to web or device in this book, discussing the merits of both in depth, but then showing design approaches that would work equally well on the web or in a native app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, there is the very important concept of &lt;strong&gt;Mobile First&lt;/strong&gt;. A principle I had first learnt about on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/Mobile/training/MobiWeb108/&#34; title=&#34;Introduction to W3C Mobile Web and Application Best Practices by the W3C&#34;&gt;W3C Mobile Web Best Practices course&lt;/a&gt;, which has such a positive impact on design with minimal negatives. The ideas that making your content suitable for mobile consumption will make it a better experience for desktop users, and that mobile first results in lightweight (both visually and technically) pages that are easy to download and browse are impossible to argue against. You’ll come out of this book feeling as much an evangelist of the mobile first approach as Luke himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with other &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abookapart.com/&#34; title=&#34;A Book Apart&#34;&gt;A Book Apart Books&lt;/a&gt;, Mobile First is written in a light, readable style with a good dose of humour. Even with all the stats and graphs, each chapter is a breeze and I really enjoyed the whole book.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Designing For Emotion</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/designing-for-emotion/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2011 09:43:18 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/designing-for-emotion/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I bought &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion&#34; title=&#34;Designing For Emotion by Aarron Walter&#34;&gt;Designing For Emotion&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion-mobile-first-bundle&#34; title=&#34;Buy Designing For Emotion and Mobile First together from A Book Apart&#34;&gt;A Book Apart deal&lt;/a&gt;, alongside Mobile First. After listening to &lt;a href=&#34;http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/58&#34; title=&#34;The Big Web Show #58&#34;&gt;Jeffery Zeldman talking about the release of these books with Dan Benjamin on The Big Web Show&lt;/a&gt;, and hearing how they were perfect books to read before a redesign (my site is in a constant state of awaiting redesign) I was really eager to get stuck in. Oddly, I decided to read Mobile First second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2011/11/20111115-090800.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center size-full&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2011/11/20111115-090800.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20111115-090800.jpg&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing For Emotion is the third book I’ve read in my read-a-chapter-a-day-for-inspiration series. I write this on a train journey after greedily guzzling the last three chapters in one go as I just couldn’t stop reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aarron Walter writes in an incredibly easy style. His warm, friendly tone helps enthuse you about emotional design and gives you so much to think about beyond the old basic idea that 404 pages should be cute and funny to make your users more forgiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, this book is a lighter read than previous A Book Apart books which is really down to its subject matter. You’re given a real overview of designing for emotion and deeper case studies into how it has been practically applied to different sites but, as Aarron points out in Chapter 4:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples…are not meant to be emulated, only to get you thinking about how you can convey your brand personality in your interfaces in a way that resonates with your audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that, if you’re anything like me, you spend the whole book studying the ideas and working out how you can use similar approaches in your own projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each chapter in Designing For Emotion takes you through a principle of emotional design:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional Design (Intro/Overview)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing For Humans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional Engagement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overcoming Obstacles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forgiveness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk &amp;amp; Reward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Forgiveness chapter is more specific than others, focusing on evoking a particular emotion, but the content comes across as equally important as those in other chapters as it is such a necessary emotion to consider on the web where errors and poor performance can easily tempt users to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I found this book insanely inspirational. Partly because it’s a subject rarely covered in such depth and with so much consideration, but also because it’s almost exciting in its enthusiasm, making it easy to read quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

        Great post. I am fan of the A Book Apart series, may give this one a read after Responsive Web Design.

      <title>Insites Tour Brighton</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/insites-tour-brighton/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2011 11:56:25 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/insites-tour-brighton/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://insitestour.com/&#34;&gt;Insites&lt;/a&gt; is a mini tour of four cities in the UK where &lt;a href=&#34;http://keirwhitaker.com/&#34;&gt;Keir Whitaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://elliotjaystocks.com/&#34;&gt;Elliot Jay Stocks&lt;/a&gt; present discussions with well-known people from the web/tech industry. I was lucky enough to go to the first evening in Brighton on Monday where &lt;a href=&#34;http://aralbalkan.com/&#34;&gt;Aral Balkan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sazzy.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Sarah Parmenter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://adactio.com/&#34;&gt;Jeremy Keith&lt;/a&gt; were the guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-format&#34;&gt;The Format&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The format of the evening was something unfamiliar to most of us. Each guest was interviewed by either Keir or Elliot and then there were questions from the audience. Except it was much less formal than that. There were breaks in between and a comfortably small amount of people (I’m rubbish at estimating amounts of people so I’ll save you the pain) so there was a really relaxed and casual environment where everybody seemed happy to chat about anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genius was really in the way it was run. Keir and Elliot asked really interesting and leading questions and Aral, Sarah and Jeremy were all open and honest so they genuinely did provide insight into their lives in the web/tech industry. I don’t think it would have worked had the interviewers been unfamiliar with the guests, and with Keir and Elliot both working in the industry doing similar jobs to most people in the audience, their questions always felt appropriate and had something of the &lt;em&gt;that’s-just-what-I-wanted-to-ask&lt;/em&gt; about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-actual-insights&#34;&gt;The Actual Insights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;education&#34;&gt;Education&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that struck me about each of the guests (and a lot of people I spoke to) was that everybody was self-taught in some way. That’s really inspiring for anybody wanting to work with the web or iOS. Each of the guests hadn’t studied design or development formally yet they’re helping lead the way and set the standards in user experience, iOS design and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, despite not having formal education, Aral, Sarah and Jeremy each teach workshops. It goes to show how well they know their subject matter in order to host successful workshops, but also how the semi-formalisation of education can work and enough people seem to enjoy learning that way (rather than self-teaching through books or the web.) And a lot of people must prefer this way of learning as the amount of workshops seem to be on the up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;client-work&#34;&gt;Client Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the directions that a lot of web industry professionals seem to be taking lately is moving away from client work and towards making their own products. Aral was incredibly passionate about how much more he enjoyed working for himself in every sense, rather than having ever-changing clients for bosses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah provided some great advice on the warning signs when starting work with potential clients, as she’s had her fair share of painful client relationships, and relayed that she thinks she’s just* too* nice and so clients take advantage. As someone who completely identifies with the niceness approach, it was heartening to see that Sarah has found such great clients that she’s considering working for two exclusively. This is also interesting as it shows more of that same direction of moving away from working with different clients and towards maintaining products as a career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeremy was honest in saying he preferred to just get on with the development, and is very fortunate to work as part of an agency where Andy Budd enjoys handling the clients and accounts sides of a project. I think many freelancers find the sales and admin are the worst part of the job so it made sense that forming an agency with like-minded people would be a good idea, but Jeremy pointed out that this does only really work if there is one individual who is happy to work on the ‘business’ side whilst the others work on the project itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;outlooks&#34;&gt;Outlooks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I took away in summary to these talks was really one big point, &lt;strong&gt;everybody there was following a career path based around what makes them happy and fulfilled over what might make them rich&lt;/strong&gt;. And this really emphasises what I love so much about the industry. People are there because they enjoy it, people want to make a difference and make the web a really cool place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-the-rest&#34;&gt;And The Rest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the nature of the Insites tour, people came with a willingness to discuss work, process and dealing with clients rather than focusing on the techniques and technologies that we go on about during the working day. This lead to a few good discussions outside of the talks with the guests where I felt my brain buzzing from finally starting to understand a bit more about how we work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-am-endlessly-lucky-with-the-clients-i-have&#34;&gt;I am endlessly lucky with the clients I have&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assumed that most people had good clients. From the various discussions it does look like I am very lucky in having ended up with *predominantly* lovely, responsive, &lt;strong&gt;paying-on-time&lt;/strong&gt; clients. After talking to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mrqwest.co.uk/cc/&#34;&gt;Croydon Creatives&lt;/a&gt; bunch (and also something Sarah mentioned,) we really seemed to conclude that having a top contract is one of the most important aspects of client work. Not necessarily a boring law-speak contract, but something that appealed to the client and showed that you’re a human who deserves to be paid for your hard work, as well as laying out some &lt;em&gt;just-in-case&lt;/em&gt; terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;labels-and-titles&#34;&gt;Labels and Titles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the final fascinating conversation that was really ongoing throughout the evening outside of the talks was about labelling. It stemmed from Aral and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andybudd.com/&#34;&gt;Andy Budd&lt;/a&gt;‘s disagreement on what makes a UX Designer, but lead to discussing how we describe ourselves to clients and each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally learnt the different between ‘&lt;strong&gt;indie&lt;/strong&gt;‘ and ‘&lt;strong&gt;freelance&lt;/strong&gt;‘ (indie means you produce work for yourself or customers, freelance means you work for clients) and that Jeremy Keith works somewhere between a rotating job title and none whatsoever because it’s the work that do that speaks for you, rather than what you call yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion that I came to was that labels are a pain. Everybody is judged on what they call themselves and, within the industry, it doesn’t really matter as soon as you’re familiar with somebody’s work. What we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need labels and job titles for is accurately communicating what we do to potential clients. This means we should forget about the acronyms and jargon and sometimes the most appropriate description is ‘&lt;strong&gt;I make websites&lt;/strong&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-if-you-re-in-manchester-or-bristol-this-week-go&#34;&gt;So if you’re in Manchester or Bristol this week, go!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a day to write this post, so I’m a bit late in telling people to go to the London leg of the Insites tour, but Manchester is tonight and Bristol is tomorrow night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was definitely one of the best events I’ve attended in a while, and one that just gave me faith in how the industry and community is &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;brilliant&lt;/strong&gt; (and probably the best ever.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: please forgive my enthusiasm in this post, I hope it’s not &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; annoying, but I had a really good time!&lt;/p&gt;

        I couldn’t agree more with your thoughts on labels &amp;amp; titles, I think the same applies to CV’s (in the creative industries at least).  A list of academic achievements or awesome companies you’ve worked at doesn’t matter to me, it’s all about the quality of work *you* produce and the way in which you can articulate your ideas. 

The merits from working with great people &amp;amp; big brands definitely go some way to helping with that, but it’s not everything.

Great post, thanks for sharing –; sounds like a great evening! I’ll write the London night up when I get a chance to breathe :)

      <title>Design work is 50% visual, 50% justification</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/design-is-50percent-visual-50percent-justification-2/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;After I finished my last post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/design-tips-for-developers/&#34;&gt;Design Tips for Developers&lt;/a&gt;, it really struck me how much I wrote to justify my design. I wasn’t just writing tips saying “*do this, it’s good*“, “*don’t do this, it’s bad.*” I put time and effort into explaining why I made these decisions and why I didn’t do it another way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I send a design to a client via e-mail, I usually spend around 45 minutes –; 1 hour writing an accompanying ‘justification’. I really have no idea if I’m the only one that does this? I assume not. I know a lot of people don’t, they just send static images. Does this mean it’s not worthwhile?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-do-justifications&#34;&gt;How I do justifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an excerpt from my last post, giving a classic example of how I write justifications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve limited the ‘Latest Happenings’ to only five events on my design. My reasoning being that if you have many more than that, they’re not really ‘latest’ anymore. This way we can ensure that the amount of happenings are well-balanced with the content on the left side of the page. Although the ‘What is Lift?’ content is liable to changing, I imagine that it wouldn’t increase too much more in length, as any further information and you’re going into the depths of documentation that probably isn’t suitable for a home page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to cover all the basics of the design. I explain my choices regarding layout, typography, colour and imagery. I summarise any other methods or angles I tried that didn’t work, and explain why I thought they didn’t work. If I’m not actually sure why I did something on impulse, I’ll really think about it, analyse my decision and explain it to the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-write-justifications&#34;&gt;Why I write justifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#### Not all design work can speak for itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clients aren’t design specialists so you can’t expect them to ‘get’ your thinking behind a design just by looking at it (And you probably couldn’t expect most other designers to ‘get’ it either!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#### I don’t often get to speak to the client in person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fairly easy to quickly summarise your design when you can look at a person’s face and see if they understand you. When you’re lacking face-to-face communication, you really have to make up for it in writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#### Even if I do see a client face-to-face, I’ll often forget something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting down and writing a proper explanation helps me look over the design from top to bottom and take it apart. It also takes a while for a client to mull over a design. They might be unsure of part of it later on at home. Having your justification there to reassure them can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-was-also-taught-how&#34;&gt;I was also taught how&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every now and again I realise the huge value in being taught art and graphics at school, college and university. From secondary school art lessons onwards, one-third of the work was research, one-third was the practical application and the final third was evaluation. Even if the rest of the work wasn’t perfect, if the evaluation was good then you’d be on to a winner. It wasn’t about being skilled with a pencil or paintbrush, it was about being able to reflect, evaluate and actually understand what you were trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;being-able-to-give-a-reason&#34;&gt;Being able to give a reason&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe a huge part of your ability as a designer is understanding why you do what you do. In order to create an appropriate and usable design, you’ve got to be able to do better than ‘pretty.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a designer &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be able to tell a client the reasoning behind their design decisions. There’s nothing worse than the ‘professional’ who says “&lt;em&gt;I like it best like this and I’m the professional so you should respect my opinion&lt;/em&gt;.” Of course, everybody has their own preferences, theories and leanings, but if you can’t come up with a reason beyond “I like it” or “everybody’s doing it”, then what service are you actually providing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;value-for-a-client&#34;&gt;Value for a client&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading a description about your design decisions lets a client know you’ve really thought their design through. I’m hoping I show my clients that I spend a long time considering my design work and trying to make something that will work for them. When you’re providing a service, rather than a physical product, it’s good to remind people that you’re good value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;value-for-a-designer&#34;&gt;Value for a designer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sending a justification I find there are fewer arguments. Full stop. As I’ve got better at writing them, I’ve found more clients agree with my decisions. I hope I’m also improving as a designer, but it’s also incredibly difficult to disagree with a design element when someone has given you a very good logical reason why it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t get “make my logo bigger”, “can you do another version?” or “I want it in Papyrus”. I know I’m fantastically fortunate to work with lovely people, but I reckon explaining yourself (and maybe being a bit persuasive) might also have something to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Design Tips For Developers</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/design-tips-for-developers/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2010 16:26:24 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This little post is based around the talk I gave at Bathcamp. &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/richquick&#34;&gt;Rich Quick&lt;/a&gt; came up with the great idea that, whilst &lt;a href=&#34;http://bathcamp.org&#34;&gt;Bathcamp&lt;/a&gt; attendees are mostly developers, a talk on design for developers was probably appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you might have seen on &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/bathcamp-plea-for-bad-designs-by-developers/&#34;&gt;my post from last week&lt;/a&gt;, I was looking for a case study to use in my talk. As happens with everything, I just didn’t have time to include the case study in the talk, so I thought I would blog it here as a follow-up from Bathcamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-original&#34;&gt;The original&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/timperrett&#34;&gt;Tim Perrett&lt;/a&gt; had been asking me for a while to help redesign &lt;a href=&#34;http://liftweb.net&#34;&gt;liftweb.net&lt;/a&gt;. Even though the design isn’t awful, and I’m not even sure whether it was done by a developer, it did need some designery love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/original.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-246&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/original.png&#34; alt=&#34;liftweb.net original homepage design&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-redesign&#34;&gt;My redesign&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t aiming for a full-on redesign, more of a re-alignment of the existing design. I tried to take all the elements that I thought were successful, and continue using those, and try to improve on the areas that I thought had issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll explain my decisions below, based on my design tips for developers. I’m only including the most relevant tips from my talk, as very few designs would cover all of them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/01.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-248&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/01.png&#34; alt=&#34;my redesign of liftweb.net&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-design-tips-for-developers&#34;&gt;My Design Tips For Developers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### Design isn’t all about having an ‘eye’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people just have an ‘eye’ for design. Knowing what looks good to the masses comes fairly easily. This doesn’t mean that if you don’t have that ‘eye’, you can’t design. A lot of design principles are based on simple theories and rules that anybody can follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All good designers know the rules, the best designers know how to break them effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### Colour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;contrast-is-the-most-important-aspect-of-colour-when-you-re-trying-to-make-text-readable&#34;&gt;Contrast is the most important aspect of colour when you’re trying to make text readable&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inconsistency in colour contrast was fairly noticeable on the original Lift page. In some places, it was dark on light and in some places it was light on dark, this makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the ‘Taking Off’, ‘Flying in Formation’, ‘Team’ and ‘Wiki’ pages, the descriptions are black on a dark gradient background. This makes the text harder to read, as well as drawing attention to this part of the text as it’s significantly different from the contrast patterns on the rest of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/odd-contrast.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-249&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/odd-contrast.png&#34; alt=&#34;Black on a coloured gradient is quite hard to read&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrast is something that loads of designers get wrong, as well as developers. Silly things like light grey text on a white background, a big hit with print designers. Screens are incredibly inconsistent, and our eyesight is better saved for more important things than squinting at text on a screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really recommend using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html&#34;&gt;Jonathan Snook’s Colour Contrast Check&lt;/a&gt;. This analyses the contrast between your foreground and background colours against the WCAG guidelines. Everybody knows that guidelines are just for guidance, so I wouldn’t stress if you’re colours aren’t AAA compliant (this produces very extreme contrasts that are pretty hard on the eyes) but if you make sure your colours are AAA compliant at 18pt+ then you should be on to a readable winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/snook-colour-contrast.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-250 &#34;&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;if-you-re-going-to-use-a-strong-colour-just-use-one&#34;&gt;If you’re going to use a strong colour, just use one&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a lot of purples and blues teamed with white, the Lift page was suffering from a bit of a 90s colour scheme. The trick is to stay away from using multiple strong colours (the dark blue and purpley blue) together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/original-scheme.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-252&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/original-scheme.png&#34; alt=&#34;The original Lift main colours&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		The original Lift main colours
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To calm a design like this down, I tried using less of the extreme colour contrasts (dark blue and white) and more of the in-between, softer and more muted colours. Where I felt the purpley blues and dark blues were a bit harsh, I just toned them down to a slightly greyer version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/my-scheme.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-253&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/my-scheme.png&#34; alt=&#34;My Lift redesign main colours&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		My Lift redesign main colours
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then used these colours to help differentiate between areas of content. The original Lift design did a good job of emphasising the quotes at the top of the page through using dark text on a light background, where the rest of the page used the inverse. I took this theory further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/light-on-dark.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-255&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/light-on-dark.png&#34; alt=&#34;On the original design, you can see how the quote area stands out&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst I thought it was good to keep the quotes at the top of the page, as they’re vital to helping sell the benefits of Lift to potential high-profile groups, they’re not really as valuable as the four links below to ‘Get Started’, ‘Lift community’ etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this content, and the content immediately below is most useful to the page visitors, I used the dark-on-light contrast to draw the user to those areas. It stands out more than the light-on-dark areas above as it is a greater contrast against the overall page background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/dark-on-ligt.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-256&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/dark-on-ligt.png&#34; alt=&#34;At this small size, you can see how my redesign draws the eye to the most important content&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;At this small size, you can see how my redesign colours draw the eye to the most important content
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### Layout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;give-everything-more-space-and-share-the-space-equally-between-the-elements&#34;&gt;Give everything more space, and share the space equally between the elements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look at the original design, what really jumps out is the huge amount of space in the middle of the page. This is caused by the amount of ‘Latest Happenings’ appearing down the right hand column. Obviously, this wouldn’t have been originally designed like this, but it emphasises the importance of imagining how the content on a page may evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/original-middle.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-258&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/original-middle.png&#34; alt=&#34;the main page content on the original Lift page&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		the main page content on the original Lift page
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve limited the ‘Latest Happenings’ to only five events on my design. My reasoning being that if you have many more than that, they’re not really ‘latest’ anymore. This way we can ensure that the amount of happenings are well-balanced with the content on the left side of the page. Although the ‘What is Lift?’ content is liable to changing, I imagine that it wouldn’t increase too much more in length, as any further information and you’re going into the depths of documentation that probably isn’t suitable for a home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/middle.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-259&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/middle.png&#34; alt=&#34;my redesigned main content area&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		my redesigned main content area
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt that the ‘What is Scala?’ and ‘Lift Books’ information was also a little hidden-away at the bottom of the ‘Latest Happenings’ sidebar. I brought this out into its own area underneath the main content and gave it a light-on-dark contrast to clearly separate it from the content above. This also makes the text look less intimidating. As the areas are clearly separated, it doesn’t look like a huge amount to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;try-to-base-your-design-around-a-grid&#34;&gt;Try to base your design around a grid&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With some large areas of white space and some slightly squashed looking text in boxes, the structure of the original page design doesn’t look like it is based on a grid. However it is fairly simply laid-out and does have gridded elements to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a grid makes a lot of the design decisions less of a decision, as your grid will help dictate where the elements belong. Little details like having all the bottom of the text line up against a base grid, and main content areas having the same proportions, make a design look a lot cleaner and much classier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/gridded.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-261&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/gridded.png&#34; alt=&#34;The grid I used for my redesign&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		The grid I used for my redesign
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above you can see how I used a grid to line up all of my elements. I started with a main content area width of 960px. This is a useful value as it’s divisible by many different multiples, giving you nice round numbers to work with. It doesn’t really matter if you’re using pixels, ems or percentages, it’s just working from one value to get your proportions that helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The yellow grid lines are where I started, I divided my main content area into four, as this suited the four main calls-to-action (‘Get Started’, ‘Lift Community’) well. Usually, I’d probably design around three columns as this corresponds well with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_section&#34;&gt;golden section&lt;/a&gt; which creates a very harmonious balance in your design. You can combine three and four column grids in one, but this is probably a bit complicated for this post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of my main content areas sit within these yellow columns. The logo is in the first column, the navigation in the next three columns. The testimonials sit in all four columns, and the calls-to-action each sit in their own column. The main content areas are split into two sets of two columns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What might stand out to you is that the ‘Demo’ and ‘Download’ buttons don’t sit entirely comfortably into columns. This is intentional. By moving some elements out of the column structure, it creates a tension against those that are within the columns, and draws attention to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The orange lines are an example of how I divided the columns further to decide where the margins should be. Each column of about 240px is divided by 4 and then those columns are divided by 2 again to get 30px, which is the width of the margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For areas like the width of the selected testimonial link, I just split the column by two as I needed a wider space to hold that text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also used the yellow grid lines for rows. It’s hard designing with rows on a web design as the content is always liable to change and no longer fit within those rows if there’s more or less text or an image gets put in. You can see that the content roughly sits on these rows by not completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually work on all web designs with a 10px square grid underneath as a baseline for all content, especially text. As most of the text has a line-height of 25px, every other line of text sits on the 10px grid. Below is what a small segment of the design looks like sitting on a 10px grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s where the bananas go. &lt;em&gt;Just seeing if you’re still here!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;imagery&#34;&gt;Imagery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;avoid-generic-stock-photography&#34;&gt;Avoid generic stock photography&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know the original page didn’t have any stock photography. In fact, I think that was the problem. There wasn’t any kind of imagery to break up the text. The closest it came was quote marks and gradients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first off I found some appropriate images to illustrate the content. A quick bit of Googling and I located the book covers for the Lift books. This will make the books easier to identify in passing, and really work to break up that text-heavy area at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-04-at-15.41.35.png&#34;&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty in sites about web development and other non-visual subjects is there isn’t much in the way of obvious imagery you can use to illustrate your pages. But stay away from the stock photos! These are never the solution as they mostly look generic, cheesy and cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustrations can be expensive, though stock illustrations are often better than stock photos. However there are a lot of high quality free icon sets out there. If you find icons relevant to the content, they can serve to break up a very text-heavy site &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; act as signifiers to help the user understand what the text, call-to-action or button is for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/icons.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-268&#34;&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a look through my icon collections and found some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iconeden.com/icon/shine.html&#34;&gt;Shine icons&lt;/a&gt; that suited the content and were the right sizes for button links and bigger calls-to-action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;use-subtle-patterns-and-textures-to-add-depth-to-a-page&#34;&gt;Use subtle patterns and textures to add depth to a page&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d almost completed my design, and it felt like it was looking a bit flat. This is usually the way when you’re using a different solid colours. To combat this effect, I added some subtle noise and shadows to give it a more ‘real’ feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/noise2.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-272&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/noise2.png&#34; alt=&#34;the background of my redesign without (above) and with (below) noise textured background&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know I’d usually say that something like ‘noise’ is &lt;a href=&#34;http://dribbble.com/search?q=noise&amp;amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;amp;y=0&#34; title=&#34;Search noise on Dribbble&#34;&gt;possibly a current trend&lt;/a&gt;, but I think it’s more of a recent discovery. It’s all very well using grungy textures if it’s appropriate to your site, but it really wouldn’t be for most software, corporate or family sites. Subtle noise is a great way to add some texture and definition without theming a site. Just make sure it’s very gentle. It looks best when not instantly visible, it should be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; subtle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### Light&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;choose-one-imaginary-light-source-and-make-the-shadows-follow-that-source&#34;&gt;Choose one imaginary light source, and make the shadows follow that source&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that people forget when they use gradients, box shadows and text shadows on websites is that these elements are all used to recreate the illusion of light. Having light and dark on a site imitates real life, it makes your design more ‘real’, it makes it easier for your users to identify with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incoming problems with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.css3.info/&#34;&gt;CSS3&lt;/a&gt; is that people are using shadows willy-nilly, chucking them in to make their design look fancy without thinking about the effect they’re creating. This is visible on the random text-shadow on the original Lift design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/odd-contrast.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-249&#34;&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If  you want to use gradients and shadows to make your site feel more real, and give it more depth, the trick is to choose a natural-style imaginary light source, and make all your shadows follow that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could be two light sources, though that could quickly get complicated, and beyond the realms of CSS, so I just went with the simplest possible for my design–;top-down. I imagined there was a light behind/above me and so it was projecting shadows that were equal sizes on each side of the boxes. It might not be completely scientifically sound, but it’s close-enough to feel real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/11/shadows.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-273&#34;&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Light shadows visible around the boxes
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colour is also important. Since when have you seen a white shadow? Pure black shadows are also very rare unless it’s very very dark. A shadow is usually just a darker shade of the surface it’s casting on to, follow that principle and you’ll have realism in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;make-your-light-source-subtle&#34;&gt;Make your light source subtle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other issue with the text shadow on the original Lift design is that it’s really screamingly obvious. From day-to-day we don’t really notice or comment on shadows much, even though they’re used &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;, occurring in real life and almost every piece of software. The reason we barely notice is them is because they’re so subtle. I know I’ve used the ‘subtle’ word about a million times now but it really is the key to making a design look sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### If in doubt, keep it simple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;less-looks-more-sophisticated&#34;&gt;Less looks more sophisticated&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no crime in creating a site with a white background, and no crime in being ‘basic.’ All the best sites are noted for their simplicity and how clean they look and not how garish and full-of-stuff (my particular design weakness) they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hope these tips and this sort-of walkthrough has been helpful. I’ll be happy to do more in the future if anybody wants them, or further explain any more elements of this design if anybody asks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Good old designer snobbery is alive and kicking</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/good-old-designer-snobbery-is-live-and-kicking/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2010 10:38:28 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/good-old-designer-snobbery-is-live-and-kicking/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;There’s one thing that I hate about being a designer and that’s the snobbery. Most, if not all, designers are a little bit guilty of looking down on other people’s work. Comments such as “Pah! They used Comic Sans” or “Ergh! Don’t they know reflections are so out of date now?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are comments I’m 100% guilty of saying, but I think the problem is the outlet. If it’s a quick chatter between friends then there’s not much lost except making yourself look like a bit of an arse, but start broadcasting these harsh judgements to the world and you’ll rapidly give the impression of a big ego, huge mouth and tiny brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dribbble-egos&#34;&gt;Dribbble Egos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been feeling the need to unfollow people recently, when their Dribbble ego has been massively over-inflated. Dribbble is an exclusive community in its nature of being invite-only. However, far too many people see it as owning an invite means you are in some way superior to anybody that doesn’t have an invite. As seen on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everybody, I’ve got a Dribbble invite. Send me a link to your portfolio and I’ll give my invite away to the best one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What baffles me is that not many other people seem to think &lt;strong&gt;this is wrong&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-s-the-point-in-a-community-of-elite-designers&#34;&gt;What’s the point in a community of elite designers?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sit and caress each other’s egos,  posting shots mimicking each other and establishing trends, and to gawk at ‘weblebrities’ and instantly hit ‘Like’ on anything they produce without even looking at it first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this is what a large part of Dribbble has become, partly due to the attitudes of those that send out tweets like above. There’s no value in a community where everybody is doing the same thing, adhering to the same rules and spending all day telling people how lovely they are. The best and most useful comments on Dribbble are those that offer constructive criticism. The most interesting shots are from previously unheard-of people because we’re being introduced to a new way of thinking, not the same old rut that the ‘weblebrities’ are stuck in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;and-who-are-you-to-judge&#34;&gt;And who are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to judge?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that irritates upsets me the most is that the aforementioned tweet comes with the assumption that the tweeter is better than those who are sending them their portfolios. Who are they to judge the quality of somebody’s work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even if the work is undeniably poor. Who are you to prevent these people from growing? One of the premises of the Dribbble community that really appealed to me was sharing criticisms with people you don’t know. Having your work critiqued by somebody else helps you learn how other people see your work, introduces you to alternatives that you may never consider, and occasionally gives you a boost in self-confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works the other way round too. By constructively criticising other people’s work, you challenge your own perspective on design. By trying to come up with helpful suggestions and interpretations, you’re learning to understand more than ‘like this,’ ‘hate that.’ This is how designers grow. Whether the criticism comes from clients or other designers, it’s all of value, and who is the tweeter above to deny other people the opportunity to indulge in such creative and useful practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gap-logo&#34;&gt;The Gap Logo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late last night the furore over the Gap logo redesign came about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-06-at-10.09.54.png&#34;&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://alpha.drawar.com/posts/The-World-isn-t-a-Dribbble-Showcase&#34; title=&#34;The World isn&#39;t a Dribbble Showcase on Drawar&#34;&gt;Scrivs&lt;/a&gt; puts it way better than I could but it seems like madness. The logo isn’t &lt;em&gt;that bad&lt;/em&gt;. It’s average, and thus an improvement on 99% of logos in the world. Get some perspective!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-quick-to-be-rude-about-other-people-s-work&#34;&gt;So quick to be rude about other people’s work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://matt-fuller.com&#34; title=&#34;Matt Fuller&#39;s blog&#34;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; coined a great term for these type of people, ‘keyboard heroes.’ The kind of people who are all full of bravado and aggression when they’re hiding behind a keyboard, but would stay quiet when talking to somebody’s face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, we’re all guilty of this from time to time. Twitter is perfect for getting your snap judgements out there and having 140 character tantrums. None of these tweets said “it would look better if they’d put some spacing between the letters” or “a solid blue square would have tied in better with the old branding.” It was straight to spitting vitriol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;could-you-do-any-better&#34;&gt;Could you do any better?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the classic. That the majority of people slating the Gap logo could certainly not do any better. How do you know what the brief was and whether the logo fits it? These people don’t understand the context so it would be very difficult to understand whether it delivers the desired effect. I don’t think it’s a great logo, but I don’t think I could do much better without knowing what Gap were going for. I believe that unless you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do better, then maybe you should use your keen eye to help improve your own work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hi,

I wholeheartedly agree with everything you said about dribbble, keyboard heroes and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
However I feel that commenting on a brands redesign (however negative the comments are) is not a bad thing, after all, it is not about doing better than them, or feeling that you are a better designer, it is about the confusion caused by the release of these redesigns.

&lt;p&gt;If GAP&amp;#039;s logo brief was set, and this ticked all the boxes, then the brief in my opinion was a poor one (but who am I to judge?!)

They seem to have implemented a lot of techniques that would benefit different logos, but the GAP logo, with all 3 letters of it, does not need to be more legibility, it is still constrained by the orientation you could place it in, it uses gradients which I haven&amp;#039;t looked at in grayscale but I imagine don&amp;#039;t look as clean as the original logo etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;
So in my opinion all the bad mouthing of the new design is not about other designers being better, or the logo being un-usable, it is about the confusion how they got from the original logo to the new logo without seeing the brief (after all we will never see it)
    &lt;/div&gt;

        If you&amp;#039;ve got constructive criticisms (like yours above) then I think negative opinions are perfectly valid. It&amp;#039;s when people say things like &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s rubbish&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;looks like it was designed by an idiot&amp;quot; that they come across as unnecessary.

I call them cewebrity&amp;#039;s btw.

        Great article Laura!! I feel exactly the same about the whole Dribbble thing and the &amp;quot;weblebrities&amp;quot;. What really bothers me the most is that criticizing people has become so easy on the web. Writing harsh things is so much easier than telling someone the design he or she&amp;#039;s been working on is crap from face to face and criticizing without adding constructive thoughts about how to do it better is even easier. On the other hand all those &amp;quot;You are so fucking great and I love everything you do&amp;quot; comments are bullshit as well. I guess those comments are a part of the success of Dribbble because everybody loves to be told what a great designer he is. But it&amp;#039;s a total waste of time when those comments get so unrelated to the real quality of the submitted designs.
    &lt;/div&gt;

And honestly, who really gives a crap what Gap do with their branding?

        Great post Laura!

On personalities: I think the idea of designer &amp;quot;ego&amp;quot; in communities like Dribbble stems more from outside perception than any inside &amp;quot;celebrity&amp;quot; culture. The very nature of the site is exclusivity, but that&amp;#039;s purely for moderation and advertisement purposes. I see no problem with your example tweet, it&amp;#039;s a product of the system rather than elitism from the tweeter.  I often think those suggesting the idea of &amp;quot;celebrity designers&amp;quot; are the only ones who are labelling people celebrities in the first place.

Most people enjoy discussing and sharing great design for networking and self promotion. When congregating together they share trends, form a hierarchy, and sometimes disagree. It&amp;#039;s socialising, not elitism, though that can manifest is tiny amounts.

Saying that, I haven&amp;#039;t been on Dribbble in a while so perhaps I&amp;#039;m wrong ;)

        I don&amp;#039;t think that it&amp;#039;s just Dribbble that has examples of the designer ego. And these egos aren&amp;#039;t necessary those of the most popular Dribbblers, I&amp;#039;d say most are actually incredibly humble. You&amp;#039;re totally right in that it&amp;#039;s the hero-worshippers that propel them on to pedestals. In fact, in my experience, &amp;#039;graphic&amp;#039; design has far more dangerous egos than web design.

However, I still believe reviewing other people&amp;#039;s portfolios in such a way is arrogant. By all means, let people know you have invites, but why not invite somebody who is new and could do with some help rather than the best designer you know?
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Maybe I&amp;#039;m optimistic, but I genuinely don&amp;#039;t believe most people giving away invites in such a manner actually consider themselves judges or an authority. That would be arrogant as you say. I&amp;#039;d imagine just any many (if not more) people give away invites to friends, randomly, and with other considered choices. Choosing someone because you feel they need help is also judging them is it not? I don&amp;#039;t think any reasons are done in an arrogant manner, at least most of the time. The shortness of a tweet often results in more ambiguities and implications than intended.

Actually I&amp;#039;m being to half-full here. My point would be that the few arrogant eggs over shadow the humble lovely designers.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        I was &amp;quot;refused&amp;quot; (understandably as I&amp;#039;m sure the person had been told to) a dribbble invite when it was locked from public view as I have no work on-line. Regardless of my &amp;#039;skillz&amp;#039; (or lack of) the person couldn&amp;#039;t give me one if I didn&amp;#039;t have a high standard of work&amp;#8230; and as he couldn&amp;#039;t see my work&amp;#8230;

        I can understand refusing somebody on the grounds of not knowing somebody, not knowing if they’re just going to post stuff that is irrelevant to design (ads, aforementioned photos of cats.) However, I’m still disappointed for your predicament, it must have been hard to be refused just for that.
        &lt;/div&gt;

        Nice read Laura :)

I absolutely despise Dribbble –; always have. I am a member, but not because I jumped through my own backside to prove my worth, just because a friend invited me. There are some very talented people posting some very good work in Dribbble –; that can&amp;#039;t be denied –; but it&amp;#039;s also actively encourages and harbours the kind of elitist attitudes that you&amp;#039;ve described above (much more politely than I would have) by the way it&amp;#039;s invite only system works.

As for the Gap logo, well it is very average. Just like the iTunes logo is pretty average. Neither are *that* bad. But I think it&amp;#039;s just human nature to react negatively to change, especially with something they are so familiar with. In my time I don&amp;#039;t think I&amp;#039;ve ever witnessed a single big name rebranding that hasn&amp;#039;t been met with more negative than positive reaction. I think it&amp;#039;s the nature of the beast. You need to be tough-skinned to be a logo designer.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Laura,

As being on dribbble from a very early start, nearly a year I think its worth a comment. I don&amp;#039;t agree with a lot of what has been said. I know a lot of designers not just on dribbble but from the community.

Where as I can not talk about other designers as everyone is unique I can talk about myself. Regarding the tweets for invites, I myself do this where people who want in can send me their portfolio to look at. I do turn away the ones that at the moment are not up to standard. The reason for this is not elitism to massage my &amp;quot;EGO&amp;quot; but for the good of the community. People with sub standard work would in fact find it hard to associate with the community in general as if their work is not of a high standard how can they comment on things that they do not know?

However I do understand that there is a problem with snobbery in the community, this is not to do with the &amp;quot;weblebrities&amp;quot; its more of the jealous people who think that they should be. The type of person who gets Photoshop but not design in general. The same person will visit gallery sites time and time again and be &amp;quot;inspired from x and y design&amp;quot;, when in fact they should only visit them for the planning stage at all.

Also think about the people who are &amp;quot;weblebrities&amp;quot; they do not chose this, it is the same in any area of life. The people who are marketed well at being good at something will always attract people who want to be them. I have talked to a lot of these &amp;quot;weblebrities&amp;quot; and they are some of the most nicest and humble people you can talk to. Just imagine for a second that your workload is putting you under a lot of stress and then a stranger asks a question that will take 20mins of your already busy schedule you wont be able to answer straight away and it sadly gets pushed back to the que. I am no means a &amp;quot;weblebrities&amp;quot; but I get emails daily asking things from &amp;quot;How can I get better&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;What books do you recommend&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;can you look over my work&amp;quot; etc and it gets tiring but sadly that is life.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        Guilty as charged. On both counts.

This is the **only** reason I may ask for work when giving out an invite is down to this piece of text on the site:

&amp;lt;blockquote cite=&amp;quot;[http://dribbble.com/account/invitations&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Help](http://dribbble.com/account/invitations%22%3EHelp&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow) keep the league clean. Resist the urge to send invites to folks who enjoy uploading photos of their cat.

Also! The players you draft will show up in your &amp;ldquo;drafted list&amp;rdquo; so we&amp;rsquo;ll know who to blame for the aforementioned cat photos.

Re: the Gap logo –; yes. It looks bad, but yeah, what the hell would we do when someone like the Gap asks us to redesign? ISO50 is trying to get the &amp;#039;keyboard heroes&amp;#039; to come up with something better: [](http://blog.iso50.com/2010/10/05/gap-redesign-contest/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow)[http://blog.iso50.com/2010/10/05/gap-redesign-con](http://blog.iso50.com/2010/10/05/gap-redesign-con&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow)&amp;#8230; but is this spec work.

        It&amp;#039;s cleverly worded. It doesn&amp;#039;t at any point say &amp;quot;don&amp;#039;t invite inferior work.&amp;quot; It&amp;#039;s saying no LOLcats. However, it implies that you shouldn&amp;#039;t invite anybody whose posts would make you feel ashamed. If you&amp;#039;re ashamed of inviting somebody because their work isn&amp;#039;t of a professional level, maybe that is more significant of your feelings?

        Great article Laura! I&amp;#039;ve been guilty of jumping on the GAP logo bandwagon my self, its very easy to fire something of on Twitter without stopping to think it through first. As for Dribbble I&amp;#039;m not a member nor am I going to jump through hoops to become one but any site that helps with the creative process can only be a good thing in the end. In any community you&amp;#039;re going to get good eggs and bad eggs.

PS Anyone got  a dribbble invite? :-)
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Thanks for a great post Laura. For those designers that are so busy they can&amp;#039;t be bothered here&amp;#039;s an idea: put together a canned response with links to your favorite resources, then as you are inundated with questions from strangers aspiring to produce work of a &amp;quot;high standard&amp;quot;, you can quickly reply to them and welcome them into the community. Just sayin&amp;#8230;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        The word on the street is that Gap&amp;#039;s new logo was not designed under a brief, but was unexpectedly plucked from a presentation by a corporate chieftan who resides outside the marketing department. Essentially, the design &amp;amp; marketing team had no voice.

Critiques become elitist and petty when people begin claim they can (or have) produced better work. While this may be true, it ignores the reality of the design process as a collaboration between designer and client. When the collaboration fails, the work fails. The Gap logo is a great example of a non-existent collaboration between art and commerce that could cost the company significant brand equity.

So I think it&amp;#039;s fair to criticize Gap&amp;#039;s move as a misunderstanding of design. &amp;quot;New&amp;quot; isn&amp;#039;t enough. The logo itself lacked a substantive discovery phase, so they ended up with an ill conceived mark for the brand. As designers, I think it&amp;#039;s important that we voice critiques of new work as a means of validating (or invalidating) the decisions made by all parties involved.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        This web celebrity thing is getting out of hand. I find it implausible people are referring to themselves as rock stars and ninjas when we&amp;#039;re essentially a service industry.

I don&amp;#039;t see plumbers putting each other on a pedestal, or stepping out and calling themselves rock stars, ninjas and the like. I don&amp;#039;t see mechanics putting together Top Trumps-style cards (any one remember Type Faces?).

It&amp;#039;s all, for want of a better term, a load of bollocks. I joined Dribbble earlier this year, and as soon as the novelty wore off grew dissatisfied with it. There&amp;#039;s no community feel to the website, but more so establishing trends and a breeding ground for iTunes 10 replacement logos, or GAP replacement logos, or whatever will come along next week that the community at large decide isn&amp;#039;t worthy.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Another great post Laura! I&amp;#039;ve always thought Dribbble was or seems elitist. Yes granted the work on there is exceptional but wanting to keep the bar high is for who&amp;#039;s benefit, is it just for the purpose of having comments filled with &amp;quot;awesome&amp;quot;? I&amp;#039;m a member on Forrst and its audience is a bit more wider than Dribbble I see good and great designs as well as not so good design and I am sure people may have made that assumption with my own work too. But the &amp;quot;not so great&amp;quot; designs aren&amp;#039;t bad they&amp;#039;ve just lacked direction, same with my own but its the critiquing that what makes somebody better, being able to see somebody&amp;#039;s point that you&amp;#039;ve not seen and improving ones self.  Thus being able to then help others. We&amp;#039;ve all read on blogs about partnering up with somebody or learning from somebody is great and all about a community environment, well these places are the perfect opportunity yet Dribbble users go a little quiet when drafting somebody new or upcoming. If you give somebody a chance they will prove they are good enough.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Most &amp;quot;social networks&amp;quot; are (in function) online popularity contests&amp;#8230; pretty much the same thing that occurs in many real-life social situations. The main problem that I see people with Dribbble is that of &lt;i&gt;expectations&lt;/i&gt;.

As a non-Dribbbler, I use the site mainly for inspiration, and I usually come away with fresh ideas or approaches. I also enjoy discovering (for myself) other designers and their work through the site.

I almost never read the comments, by the way (I agree that the dialog on the site is almost comically one-dimensional).
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Laura, good post and a very valid point :) i agree about the snobbery, didn&amp;#039;t really see much point to dribble as you said there&amp;#039;s not much criticism there.. but the gap logo –; i&amp;#039;m one of those that think it&amp;#039;s not an improvement. and i&amp;#039;m not criticising the designers. it was probably design by committee anyway :) just think that it&amp;#039;s really awkward and somehow a step down from what they had&amp;#8230;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        I wholeheartedly agree. I have been thinking the exact same thing for some time now, I have just never been able to express it as well as you have.

My thoughts on Dribbble –; I use it the odd time to publish snippets of work for feedback (which is what it should be used for) but rarely receive any –; probably because I&amp;#039;m not a weblebrity and even if I was I&amp;#039;d imagine I would just receive a bunch of back-pats and well dones.

My main issue is that the real sheep mentality of following our weblebrity leaders not only filters down into comments and follows, it appears in the *actual work*. People quickly lose their own identity and uniqueness on Dribbble to produce work like their newfound idols. The debuts and popular pages contain the same tall-white-sans-serif-noise-backgrounds images as the day before and the day before that. All because of this follow-the-leader mentality.

Now I feel like a bit of a hypocrite for releasing my own tirade of design snobbery on the designs of most of the Dribbble community, although it comes from a concerned place for fear of a global design trend discouraging individuality.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        I&amp;#039;ve got two dribbble invites&amp;#8230; send me your portfolio so I can decide if I want to be associated with you.

hehehe!

I&amp;#039;m a bit torn about the whole situation, but, at the same time, there&amp;#039;s still a lot of rubbish designers on dribbble anyway (sorry, let me rephrase that as designers who are first starting out who need a lot of help to improve), and while I&amp;#039;m not a regular user the system, I think it&amp;#039;s good to have a place to show things off to your peers.  Snobbery in design is not a new thing (I hung out with some architects recently and oh do they think web design is not a very noble profession!), and while you can claim you don&amp;#039;t like it, you&amp;#039;re not going to stop it.

When I&amp;#039;m excited about something cool I&amp;#039;ve done, what&amp;#039;s wrong with showing it to the type of people who might give you compliments?
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Hey Laura,

Great post. What irritates me most about the keyboard heroes tweeting one-line criticisms is that they just don&amp;#039;t know enough about what they&amp;#039;re criticizing.

&lt;p&gt;To criticize a creation properly you need to know the designer, the contract, and the client.

It takes three to tango [http://www.contrast.ie/blog/three-to-tango/](http://www.contrast.ie/blog/three-to-tango/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for writing,

Des&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

        The beauty and uniqueness of Dribbble is exactly in the fact that it is a hand-picked and a &amp;#039;gated&amp;#039; community. Aren&amp;#039;t there a lot of different places that are open for all, like DeviantArt.

While elitism sounds like a curse word it can be beneficial like I think it is in this case, we could also call it with a name that I find more appropriate in this case –; &lt;b&gt;peer review&lt;/b&gt;.

Snobbery is a sad and stupid trait and should be (IMHO) ignored when it springs up, but let&amp;#039;s not associate it directly with peer review.
    &lt;/div&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I was a bit skeptical about dConstruct at first. The idea of a conference based on ‘creativity and ideas’ made me worry it might be a bit pretentious but I was convinced by a lot of friends on Twitter that it’d be worthwhile, and they were so right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went with a notebook and an open mind. I didn’t want to go all reverse-snob on the pretentious (something I’m generally pretty guilty of being) and be ignorant of learning when I’d paid ££s for the pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I ended up writing reams. Well, seven sides of a scruffy notebook, so here are the best bits I remember from each talk for the benefit of my friends who couldn’t be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summaries&#34;&gt;Summaries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to summarise the main ideas from the talks. If I totally missed the point or didn’t do it justice, I’m really sorry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;marty-neumeier-the-designful-company&#34;&gt;Marty Neumeier — The Designful Company&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Branding is about how the consumer &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; about your product. To differentiate your brand from others, you must be good &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;brendan-dawes-boil-simmer-reduce&#34;&gt;Brendan Dawes — Boil, Simmer, Reduce&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collect as much inspiration and information as possible, consider it all and the reduce it down until there’s nothing left to take away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;david-mccandless-information-is-beautiful&#34;&gt;David McCandless — Information Is Beautiful&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infographics can be used to help us understand and relate to the huge amount of information and data we’re drowning in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Letters can say more than the words they spell. Picking fonts for a project is like picking shoes for an outfit, you must pick the most contextually appropriate font.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-gruber-the-auteur-theory-of-design&#34;&gt;John Gruber — The Auteur Theory Of Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like in film production, collaborative web projects can benefit from an auteur who acts as an arbiter of taste and strives for high quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hannah-donovan-jam-session-what-improvisation-can-teach-us-about-design&#34;&gt;Hannah Donovan — Jam Session: What Improvisation Can Teach Us About Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can learn about improvisation in design from improvisation in music. Making sure tools don’t get in the way, we have a structure to follow and roles to keep, to help us free our self-expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;james-bridle-the-value-of-ruins&#34;&gt;James Bridle — The Value Of Ruins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to make sure information is being kept, given history, value and versions to help us understand its context, the world and protect the information from cultural destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tom-coates-everything-the-network-touches&#34;&gt;Tom Coates — Everything The Network Touches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future is in the connectivity of data, up to huge scales such a cities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nerd are cool because they really care about something. It’s great to be a nerd because you suck up huge quantities of information. It’s important to ensure you keep the information up-to-date and relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;various-points-and-ideas&#34;&gt;Various points and ideas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to capture some of the ideas from my notes in this mind map thing, in addition/support to the summaries. If you can read my writing, you might find it interesting. I just did it to help cement the ideas in my head as I’m one of those people who has to write something down a million times to get it to stick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overall-conference-thoughts&#34;&gt;Overall conference thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more people I know, the better conferences always are. It can be pretty hard to get chatting to somebody you don’t know in a room full of people who are stereotypically shy (especially when you’re in a minority of girls and so stick out like a sore thumb!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved Brighton as a destination (pretty easy travel for me) and the venue was very smart. It was a bit tricky to write notes in the darker parts of the theatre but wouldn’t be so hard on back-lit devices (I opted for paper as I’m still really slow on iPad.) It would have been great to charge my iPhone/iPad during the talks as most of my break times were spent out of the venue trying to find non-coffee/tea refreshments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I noticed in particular was that there weren’t any questions at the end of the talks. In a way this was good because it prevented the awkward silence that is often heralded with ‘Any questions?’ at other conferences. However, it did give you the feeling of one-way communication. Much more like being at a lecture than being in a lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was good to see speakers I hadn’t seen before too. I think I’d already seen a variation of Brendan Dawes’ talk at Future Of Web Design, but otherwise the talks and speakers were totally new to me. This was refreshing over some of the conference veterans, because how much do you practice what you preach when you spend your whole time touring a talk?!&lt;/p&gt;

        Justin and Laura,

These are exactly the goals of dConstruct –; always have been. There are workshops alongside the conference which teach more practical skills-based stuff, but the conference day itself is all about getting people to think outside of their day-to-day work: to inspire, to excite, and (perhaps most of all) to motivate.

So glad you enjoyed it –; and see you next year!
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        I was a little bit dubious about the conference at first as well.

By lunch time I was thinking that the Web Directions conference in London was much better.  At Web Directions they were talking about technologies that we could use now and running through real life examples, something that gave the dev side of me some excitement to get home and straight to work.

At the end of dConstruct I met up with my girlfriend who was eager to hear about the day.  I started with &amp;quot;Actually the last conference I went to was much better, but&amp;#8230;.&amp;quot;

What followed from that &amp;quot;but&amp;#8230;.&amp;quot; was 90 minutes of explaining my thoughts and ideas and the concepts the speakers discussed during the conference.

I realised it *was* an awesome conference, and I think you&amp;#039;re descriptions and mind map are great examples of that.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Couldn&amp;#039;t agree more! When there are so many technique-driven talks out there, it can be easy to judge the more ideas-based talks as pretentious when they&amp;#039;re actually really valuable fuel for the brain!
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
