	We didn’t have an Ind.ie roundup the previous week because we were moving, though Aral wrote a quick update on what’s happening with our move. Last week we were roundup-less again, as we heard the sad news that Caspar Bowden had died. We decided that, instead of the usual roundup, we’d take a look at Caspar’s privacy advocacy in tribute to his work. <a href="/farewell-caspar/">Read Farewell Caspar</a>.

	At the beginning of the week, I had fun talking to Victor Johnson on Episode 9 of the Subjective podcast, ‘Free As In Liberty.’ I ranted a lot, and we talked about Ind.ie, diversity, my upbringing, and how I got into design and the web.
Subjective is also a great podcast in its infancy, with Victor at the helm, it’s definitely one to watch (or listen!) <a href="/subjective-podcast/">Read Interview on the Subjective podcast</a>.

	Last Friday’s Ind.ie roundup had more on corporate surveillance, a couple of great videos with Edward Snowden, and Europe fighting back against Google and Facebook.
It took me a long time to pull it all together. I’m going to have to start writing my Friday roundups on Thursday! If you know of any interesting or relevant links, please let me know :) <a href="/europe-fights-back/">Read Europe fights back</a>.

	Every Friday I write a roundup of great links we at Ind.ie have seen over the last week. I’m not going to lie, it’s a lot of fun. I finally have an excuse to sit and properly read articles that are related to independence, privacy, human rights, democracy, diversity and more. I feel more well-informed as a result!
The roundups started out as just lists of links, but have now evolved into a little article each week where I collect the best reads together under common themes and occasionally a bit of analysis. <a href="/my-friday-roundup-for-ind-ie/">Read My Friday Roundup for Ind.ie</a>.

	Last week, my column on The Illusion Of Free was published on A List Apart. I took a lot of time writing it, as I think it’s an incredibly important issue, and it reflects my thinking around Ind.ie. As ever, a massive thank you to the wonderful editor Rose Weisburd who helped me round things out, made me sound smarter and encouraged me in the first place. <a href="/the-illusion-of-free-on-a-list-apart/">Read The Illusion Of Free on A List Apart</a>.

	Jeremy Keith is a master curator of brilliant talks from wonderful speakers, and Friday’s dConstruct was a great event. Gone are the days where I write long connected writeups on conference themes. I wish I had the time, and venues like the Brighton Dome are far too dark to take notes. However, I really wanted to record and share some of the thoughts I got out of dConstruct, as I think the themes are very important. <a href="/dconstruct-2014/">Read dConstruct 2014</a>.

	There’s some big changes around here. As of Monday, I am now working with Indie Phone for 50% of my working time.
What is Indie Phone? Indie Phone is a huge, and very ambitious, project. We’re building a smart phone that allows you to own your own data. The majority of companies on the web have a simple, and potentially dangerous, business model. These companies give you services for free, and sell your data on to third parties to make their money (think Google, Facebook, Twitter). <a href="/indie-phone/">Read Becoming part of Indie Phone</a>.
