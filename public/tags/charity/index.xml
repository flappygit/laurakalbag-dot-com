      <description>When Andy Clarke challenged me to the “Give and Tell Challenge”, I was very happy to comply. Dan James, inspired by the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, came up with the challenge:
 You donate to a cause, or causes, that have meaning to you and you say why. You then challenge 3 other people to do the same thing.
 All Out I have just donated to All Out. All Out campaigns for a world where no person will have to sacrifice their family or freedom, safety or dignity, because of who they are or who they love.</description>
