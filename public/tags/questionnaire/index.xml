      <description>Design Feast have my answers to their Designer’s Quest(ionnaire) on their site.
Scroll past the scarily large photo of me quickly… their questions prompted me to think about some interesting points, especially challenges for designers:
 What are some of the challenges you encounter as a designer and how do you deal with them?
I think the greatest challenge a designer comes across is their own ego. It’s in our nature, as those that deal in creativity, we have egos that allow us to consider our work good enough to share, and good enough for clients to pay us.</description>
