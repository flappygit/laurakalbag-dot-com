      <description>Last Friday’s Ind.ie roundup had more on corporate surveillance, a couple of great videos with Edward Snowden, and Europe fighting back against Google and Facebook.
It took me a long time to pull it all together. I’m going to have to start writing my Friday roundups on Thursday! If you know of any interesting or relevant links, please let me know :)</description>

      <title>My Friday Roundup for Ind.ie</title>

      <description>Every Friday I write a roundup of great links we at Ind.ie have seen over the last week. I’m not going to lie, it’s a lot of fun. I finally have an excuse to sit and properly read articles that are related to independence, privacy, human rights, democracy, diversity and more. I feel more well-informed as a result!
The roundups started out as just lists of links, but have now evolved into a little article each week where I collect the best reads together under common themes and occasionally a bit of analysis.</description>
