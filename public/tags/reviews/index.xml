&lt;p&gt;It’s not even been a week since 51.9% UK citizens voted to leave the EU, and it’s already a mess for any business operating from, or with, British Pounds. I’ve spent today working through our finances to see how best for us to proceed in terms of currencies and bank accounts. Despite living in Sweden, we’re still tied to the UK, not least because I’m a British citizen… * shakes fist at the idiots who voted to Leave *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than the Brexit woes, we’ve been working hard on keeping Better up-to-date and fixing any teething problems we’ve had with the trackers list. Since launch we’ve updated Better (the app) twice, and updated the content (the tracker list) seven times. We’ve had loads of great reviews on the App Store, and reading these are encouraging, motivational, and the best way to start our days! :smile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re now working on the best trackers to target next, and ways to keep improving Better. As well as how to continue raising awareness alongside promoting sales to help keep us sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I nearly forgot the…&lt;/p&gt;

        But the pound’s getting stronger and stronger against USD, right? Does it cause inconveniences as well? There’s been no administrative decisions as to currencies yet, has there?
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time rolls by and it’s about time I did another diary entry. I’m going to try to get Aral and me to write more frequently now what we’re working on (&lt;a href=&#34;https://better.fyi&#34;&gt;Better&lt;/a&gt;) is out in the open. (No more talk of the hush-hush project! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the launch of Better, we’ve been keeping development going, whilst making improvements to the Better app and Better.fyi, as well as responding to emails, tweets, feedback and questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as keeping the financial and admin side ticking over, recently my biggest tasks have been getting the &lt;a href=&#34;https://better.fyi/reviews/&#34;&gt;Reviews on to Better.fyi&lt;/a&gt;, so people can see all the great stuff that has been said about Better before they buy. This is, so far, the best job ever. You don’t know how encouraging and exhilarating it is to read through brand new 5* reviews on a daily basis. I’ve danced in the office, and Aral and I have high-fived our hands raw. Thank you to those of you who have left such wonderful reviews, it has not only given us encouragement, but also let other people on the App Store know what Better is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://better.fyi/support/&#34;&gt;Support page&lt;/a&gt; to Better.fyi to answer some of the most common questions. This was something that would’ve been harder to do before the launch as we weren’t entirely sure what would come up. These questions have also shaped the rest of our copy in the app and on Better.fyi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I’ll be back to give you another update soon!&lt;/p&gt;
