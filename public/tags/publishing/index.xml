      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz/72&#34;&gt;This week’s episode of Unfinished Business&lt;/a&gt; was great fun to record. After &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/indie-phone/&#34; title=&#34;Becoming part of Indie Phone&#34;&gt;my recent move to working on Indie Phone&lt;/a&gt;, alongside my boyfriend Aral Balkan, I was curious to know how Andy and Sue have worked so well together since the beginning of Stuff and Nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent Sue some questions, which she answered and sent back to me, without Andy seeing the answers. During the show, I asked Andy about his thoughts and read Sue’s answers. Andy’s posted &lt;a href=&#34;http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/hide-sharp-objects&#34;&gt;the full list of questions and Sue’s answers on the Stuff and Nonsense blog&lt;/a&gt;. After hearing so many stories about Stuff and Nonsense on Unfinished Business, I was expecting some funny answers. I wasn’t disappointed, but I was also struck about how kind, thoughtful and caring Andy and Sue are in their working relationship. That must be their secret to working together for so long!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Friday I was a guest on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz/64&#34;&gt;Unfinished Business podcast&lt;/a&gt; again. It was a special episode as &lt;a href=&#34;http://rachelandrew.co.uk&#34;&gt;Rachel Andrew&lt;/a&gt; was also a guest (yeah, I designed her site!) I don’t like to go on about stuff like this too often, but if you’d told 21 year old me (7 years ago) that I’d be appearing on a podcast with Andy Clarke and Rachel Andrew, it would’ve blown my mind. They’re two very lovely people whose writing helped me learn about, and become so excited about, the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show is focused around the closure of Five Simple Steps, the great publishers of web-themed books, last week. I’ve never written a book, and have only recently started writing much, so I learned a lot from Andy and Rachel as seasoned writers (and ex-Five Simple Steps authors).&lt;/p&gt;
