      <title>My 2014</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Well, things didn’t slow down in 2014! So much so that I didn’t manage to write this post yesterday. In 2014 I spoke at 8 events in 4 countries, and worked with 11 clients on 15 projects before starting work full time with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ind.ie&#34;&gt;Ind.ie&lt;/a&gt; in August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a lot more, with regular slots on&lt;a href=&#34;http://alistapart.com/author/laurakalbag&#34;&gt; A List Apart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://the-pastry-box-project.net/baker/laura-kalbag&#34;&gt;The Pastry Box&lt;/a&gt;, and a series on &lt;a href=&#34;http://webstandardssherpa.com/about/authors/laura-kalbag/&#34;&gt;Getting Started With Sass on Web Standards Sherpa&lt;/a&gt;. And I had more fun on podcasts including co-hosting &lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz&#34;&gt;Unfinished Business&lt;/a&gt; with Ashley Baxter in August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I’ve summarised my year in photos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;## Following goals for 2014&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-collaborate-more&#34;&gt;1. Collaborate more.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining Ind.ie meant I went from working remotely, to suddenly working with a team of people in our house every day. It definitely resulted in a lot more collaboration!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-be-more-selective-say-no-more-often&#34;&gt;2. Be more selective, say no more often.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on in the year, I decided to only speak at an event every other month. I mostly succeeded in this, and it meant I was less stressed, and also enjoyed the events I spoke at a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-challenge-myself-physically-in-a-new-way&#34;&gt;3. Challenge myself physically in a new way.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sort-of managed this one. I tried ballet, but it’s not for me anymore. I tried Crossfit, but the nearest location is slightly too far away to attend frequently. Doing much more challenging courses of Pilates has had a positive impact on my year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals-for-2015&#34;&gt;Goals for 2015&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a big writing project to finish, which needs hard work and lot of confidence, but I also want to share more design and development writing on my blog and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ind.ie/about/blog&#34;&gt;Ind.ie blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the most of Ind.ie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life has changed a lot in the last year as I’ve started working with Ind.ie. It’s really important to me that we make a difference, and create alternatives to spyware technologies. I’ve got an amazing opportunity to work with the rest of the team to do something about the current system. I need to make sure I make the most of it, work hard, don’t let my insecurities get the better of me, and stand up for what I believe in.&lt;/p&gt;

        I wish you the achievement of the goals for the year 2015. I’ve got one question about your work.  When your effectiveness is better, when you work as a freelance? or as you work in a team?

Sorry if I made some mistakes in the sentences above. :&amp;gt;

        @Damian thanks :)

I find there’s benefits in both working freelance and in a team. There’s less disruption during the working day if you’re working alone. But when you work in a team you can make more progress coming up with ideas, learning from each other, and bouncing thoughts and problems around.
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Building a diverse speaker lineup</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/building-a-diverse-speaker-lineup/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2014 08:53:56 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/building-a-diverse-speaker-lineup/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is so good, and so incredibly valuable, that it’s deserving of more than just a passing tweet. Julie Pagano has written about ‘&lt;a href=&#34;http://juliepagano.com/blog/2014/08/26/building-a-diverse-speaker-lineup/&#34;&gt;Building a Diverse Speaker Lineup&lt;/a&gt;.’ This should be the go-to post for conference organisers, and it should be read as soon as you’re even thinking about organising an event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie’s post doesn’t just explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you want a diverse lineup (also worth reading on this topic: &lt;a href=&#34;https://aralbalkan.com/notes/on-design-and-diversity/&#34;&gt;Aral’s post, On design and diversity&lt;/a&gt;), but also &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not about collecting random people from a demographic to fill some token slot, so the mean people on the internet don’t yell at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a woman, I’m not 100% white, and I’ve spoken at (according to &lt;a href=&#34;http://lanyrd.com/profile/laurakalbag/&#34;&gt;Lanyrd&lt;/a&gt;) 30 events. Being invited to speak is still a very tricky situation. I’ve had situations where I could very easily tell that I was invited at the last minute to be a token speaker to boost the diversity of the event. But I’ve had far more situations where the organisers knew me, knew the kinds of things I like to talk about, and considered me a good fit. My experiences are largely very positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as a “minority” speaker you can feel a horrible amount of pressure to speak. There’s the feeling that if you say no, you’re allowing your groups to be under-represented. Or worse, the conference organiser can say “well I asked her, and she said no, so it’s &lt;strong&gt;her&lt;/strong&gt; fault we don’t have a diverse lineup.” It’s horrible and wrong, but it happens. And following the guidance in Julie’s post can help organisers understand how to approach speakers, and how to make their Call For Proposals more friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other problem I have as a speaker is finding the event itself generally unfriendly and alienating. I am one of those people who feels intensely uncomfortable in a dark room with lots of alcohol and loud music. I’ve avoided a lot of after parties because of casual sexist remarks that made me feel like I didn’t belong there. Julie’s section on Conference Environment can help prevent these awkward situations, and make everyone feel more welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to a few organisers complaining about being bullied for their event’s lack of diversity, Julie finishes on a brilliant note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizing a conference is hard work. Nobody is denying that. Working on making your conference diverse should be part of that work. I just gave you some insight into how you can do that. If you don’t want to do the hard work, you may receive criticism or people may not want to attend your event. That’s not bullying. That is holding you accountable for failing to do your job well. Work hard and avoid falling into the trap of the homogeneous conference lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I was a guest on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz/61&#34;&gt;Unfinished Business podcast&lt;/a&gt; again. I had a lovely time chatting to Andy about speaking at conferences, working for free and I even managed to squeeze in a rant about accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Speaking at Interlink conference in Toronto</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/speaking-at-interlink-conference-in-toronto/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2014 11:34:14 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sadly, &lt;a href=&#34;http://interlinkconference.com&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;The End of Interlink&#34;&gt;Interlink conference has been cancelled&lt;/a&gt;. I’m gutted that I won’t be visiting Canada this year, but I totally understand how difficult it is to run a conference, especially if you’re trying to put on the best possible event for your attendees and speakers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very very exciting. In June, I’m going to speak at &lt;a href=&#34;http://interlinkconference.com&#34;&gt;Interlink conference&lt;/a&gt; in Toronto, Canada. The line-up is incredible, and I can’t believe I’m a part of it. It’s also my first trip to Canada, and only my second trip to North America. I can’t wait!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://interlinkconference.com&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4242&#34;&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz/54&#34;&gt;latest Unfinished Business podcast&lt;/a&gt; has just been published, and I’m on it again! I had a lovely time talking to Andy about scheduling projects, invoicing, rates and people who don’t understand copyright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very big thank you to &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/Jo_annaP&#34;&gt;my friend Jo&lt;/a&gt; who let me take over her internet and bedroom for the recording, as our internet is still terrible!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interview with Heart Internet</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Heart Internet posted &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.heartinternet.co.uk/blog/article/interview-with-web-accessibility-champion-laura-kalbag&#34;&gt;an interview with me&lt;/a&gt; on their site. They start off saying some very kind things about me, and then it covers accessibility, design, speaking at conferences and a bit of client work. As a bonus, it’s interspersed with photos of me pulling weird faces at conferences (and being business on the phone!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My 2013</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/my-2013/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;My 2013 has been another big year. Oskar and I moved down to Brighton to live with Aral, I spoke at 13 events in 3 countries and worked with 13 clients on 20 projects. 2013 was the year of the podcast and I was a guest on 12 podcasts, most frequently with the lovely Andy Clarke on &lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz&#34;&gt;Unfinished Business&lt;/a&gt;. I also started writing a lot more, and now have &lt;a href=&#34;http://alistapart.com/author/laurakalbag&#34;&gt;my own column on A List Apart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like last year, I thought it would be fun to sum up my year in pictures. Looking back through my collection of photos, I’ve done so much that I’d forgotten half of it! But these are some of the best bits…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2013/12/osky-first-snow.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4163&#34;&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Oskar had a great start to the winter in the snow.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2013/12/responsive-day-out.jpg&#34;&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		In March I spoke at [Responsive Day Out](http://responsiveconf.com). Probably the most nervous I’ve ever been…
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		I went to see Skunk Anansie with my sister, Nini. It was the best gig I’ve experienced.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
		Every year it’s harder to get all the family in one room, but whenever we do, it’s like this…

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		While Oskar loves Brighton, he wasn’t so impressed by the salty taste of the sea.

		&lt;p&gt;
		Then winning the Critter award for Next Big Thing just a couple of weeks later made me totally giddy.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;following-goals-for-2013&#34;&gt;Following goals for 2013&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-keep-saying-yes-to-things-that-scare-me&#34;&gt;1. Keep saying yes to things that scare me&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of events I did this year was hard to manage; I was so excited at people asking me to speak at events, I said yes to too many. So 2014 will have to be a year of saying “maybe”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-get-a-better-balance-of-more-client-work-and-be-more-fussy-about-the-conferences-i-attend-19-events-in-one-year-is-too-many&#34;&gt;2. Get a better balance of more client work and be more fussy about the conferences I attend (19 events in one year is too many!)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very fussy about what I attended, only going to the few events I really wanted to be at (and missing out on a few too…) My balance on client work was much better, and I had a more consistent year financially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-be-more-efficient-with-my-time&#34;&gt;3. Be more efficient with my time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Must try harder in 2014…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals-for-2014&#34;&gt;Goals for 2014&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until I looked back over these photos, I’d not noticed how solitary 2012 was (there’s not so many people in last year’s photos!) And I want to make next year more sociable still:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be more selective, say no more often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenge myself physically in a new way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third goal is because I missed the build-up and fun of the Spartan race last year. This year I want to try something completely different. It might be returning to ballet. Might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-comments&#34;&gt;2 comments&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>I also pledge to be better</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/i-also-pledge-to-be-better/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2013 07:28:18 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/i-also-pledge-to-be-better/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This post was inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;http://farukat.es/journal/2013/10/698-i-pledge-be-better-and-i-hope-you-do-too&#34;&gt;Faruk’s great post “I Pledge To Be Better (And I Hope You Do Too)”&lt;/a&gt; where he speaks about the continuing problems with discrimination and lack of diversity in tech, and how more people should speak up about these issues. Faruk rightly says we all have the power and responsibility to make things better. I believe that when we don’t speak out about discrimination, we’re almost causing as much damage as condoning discrimination. Because it won’t just go away if we pretend it’s not there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/women-and-conferences/&#34; title=&#34;Women and conferences&#34;&gt;spoken about it before&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m all too aware of how I used to be one of those &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/about-work/e82b7ca7de03&#34; title=&#34;Fantastic post by @Shanley about women in tech for the patriarchy&#34;&gt;“Fuck You, I Got Mine”&lt;/a&gt; women. I want to make up for that. I also believe it’s important that women aren’t scared to be vocal about discrimination and diversity. In fact, it’s of the utmost importance that &lt;em&gt;nobody&lt;/em&gt; is scared to be vocal about these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As women, we need to be better allies to &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogjustine.wordpress.com/2013/10/12/because-it-needs-to-be-said/&#34;&gt;those who have suffered&lt;/a&gt;. For me, this starts with acknowledging that, whilst my own experiences have been mostly very positive, this doesn’t mean that I’m reflective of the whole industry. It’s too easy to sit in your own self-absorbed bubble. I have so much respect for the people who are standing up and speaking out for diversity, I want to show my support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-s-not-all-bad-but-it-s-more-than-bad-enough&#34;&gt;It’s not all bad, but it’s more than bad enough&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to get defensive when you’re reading posts like this, it’s easy to get annoyed at people “focusing on the bad”. I want to be clear that I love 99.99% of the people that I’ve met in the industry, and that a huge majority of people are good and mean well. But we’re not going to make anything better by refusing to see the dark side. We need to confront our problems so we know how to find the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pledge&#34;&gt;The pledge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://farukat.es/journal/2013/10/698-i-pledge-be-better-and-i-hope-you-do-too#pledge&#34;&gt;Faruk’s pledge&lt;/a&gt; (which you also can &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/KuraFire/7002725&#34;&gt;find and fork on Github&lt;/a&gt;) is a clear set of intentions to help make the industry a better place. I’ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/laurakalbag/7013814&#34;&gt;forked my own version&lt;/a&gt;, and tweaked it so that it represents my own intentions. This has mostly been removing the part about declining speaking opportunities if it’s an exclusively white/male lineup. As I’m a woman, this puts me in a slightly different position. Still, I want commit to voicing my concerns to organisers if I feel a lineup I’m included in lacks further diversity (within reason). This is a bit wooly, and is all about intentions and contexts, so isn’t so easy to put into a pledge!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-pledge-to-be-better&#34;&gt;I Pledge To Be Better&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want our industry to be a safe, welcoming and inclusive place for everyone, regardless of their gender, abilities, skin colour, sexuality, age, class, neuro-diversity or any other attribute. I acknowledge that this is not currently the case, and will do my best, to the extent that I can afford to dedicate to this, to help make ours a better community and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I value the diversity of perspectives that people with different backgrounds bring to the table. I will call out exclusionary practices, behaviours or cultures and see how, together, we can perhaps reshape them to be inclusive and supportive instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will take some time to read up on, and educate myself about issues such as sexism in our industry. I acknowledge the onus is on me to be decently informed before speaking out, calling out, or participating in these discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will examine my own privileges, uncomfortable though it may be, and do my best to recognise them going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will call out people for behaviours that I deem offensive or unacceptable, but I will do so respectfully and with civility. I will strive to educate, not antagonise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge that I will make mistakes, and that I may offend someone unintentionally with my words or actions. Rather than get defensive when called out on it, I will try my hardest to listen respectfully, and learn more instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not attend events that do not have clear &lt;a href=&#34;[http://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/conference-policies/](http://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/conference-policies/&#34; title=&#34;The Ada Initiative Conference anti-harassment policy&amp;quot;&#34;&gt;Code of Conduct policies&lt;/a&gt;, like an anti-harassment or diversity statement. I will also decline to attend events that feature, or permit to attend, any known offender of sexual assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pledge to be better, and set a positive example for others in our community, industry, and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-appeal&#34;&gt;The appeal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please blog about diversity. It doesn’t matter if you want to pledge for yourself or not, we just need to make it clear that we don’t accept discrimination in our industry. If you don’t have a blog, why not post a quick tweet? If you’re feeling unsure, &lt;a href=&#34;http://farukat.es/journal/2013/09/696-primer-sexism-tech&#34;&gt;read these two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://aralbalkan.com/notes/on-false-dichotomies-and-diversity/&#34;&gt;primers first&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was a guest on &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/ttimsmith&#34;&gt;Tim Smith&lt;/a&gt;‘s &lt;a href=&#34;http://theeastwing.net/&#34;&gt;The East Wing podcast&lt;/a&gt;. It was a pre-recorded conversation and it was great fun. You can &lt;a href=&#34;http://theeastwing.net/episodes/laura-kalbag&#34;&gt;listen to it on the East Wing website&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll be up on iTunes soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed how I got started in the industry (really sorry traditional Graphic Design people, I may have generalised a bit…), speaking at conferences, women in the industry and mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/laurakalbag/status/298862630506991616&#34;&gt;I said last night on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Tim Smith is such a great guy. I really had my heart warmed and faith in humanity boosted by our conversation. His thoughts on women in the industry made me proud to be part of the web community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you don’t already &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-east-wing/id503801143?mt=2&#34;&gt;subscribe to The East Wing podcast&lt;/a&gt;, do it! It’s full of great, and inspiring, insight on the people behind the work in the web industry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Women and conferences</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/women-and-conferences/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2013 21:39:47 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I used to not understand the fuss around women at conferences, I thought that we should all just carry on with what we were doing well already and not get caught up in needless controversy. I even &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/women-in/&#34; title=&#34;Women in…&#34;&gt;wrote a blog post saying exactly that a couple of years ago&lt;/a&gt;. I’d never experienced (to my knowledge) any difficulties because I was a woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-bit-uncomfortable&#34;&gt;A bit uncomfortable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I started hearing more about/was exposed to women who did have bad experiences. And I attended a few events where I just didn’t feel comfortable. It took me a while to pinpoint why I didn’t feel right. I didn’t realise right away that it was the lack of diversity that made me feel singled out. I realised that it was also the reason I felt uncomfortable when I was invited to women-only events. It wasn’t because I want to be surrounded by women, it’s because I want to be surrounded by diversity. It’s unique perspectives that bring more interesting solutions to problems and promote innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-s-hard-to-know-if-you-re-not-being-welcoming&#34;&gt;It’s hard to know if you’re not being welcoming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At these events where I felt uncomfortable, I didn’t have any &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; experiences, it was more that I felt people didn’t expect me to be there; I wasn’t the target audience. So rarely in these situations is there gender-based discrimination, it’s usually just ignorant comments based on stereotypes like “I didn’t think you’d be a developer, I thought girls were usually designers.” It was always the case that the men making the comments or featuring scantily-clad women in their presentations didn’t realise the effect these things might have on the audience, or that they might be alienating people. This is half of the problem, when you’re someone who’s rarely on the receiving end of these things, it’s hard to understand the effect they could have on others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;feeling-special&#34;&gt;Feeling special&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I think I was trying to protect in my defensive blog post was that sometimes I could see the upsides of being singled out. It made me feel special in my uniqueness, like I had something that no one else had, and I got more attention because of it. I’m a bit ashamed, but I’m not too angry at my former self because I think that’s a fairly normal thing to feel, everybody wants to feel like one in a million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also a bit nervous, I didn’t want to have the spotlight put on me for the wrong reasons. I’d done a couple of talks at bar camps, and I quite liked the idea of doing more in the future. I didn’t want to be cast as “the token girl” speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-it-s-worth-effecting-change&#34;&gt;Why it’s worth effecting change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big deal now is about the amount of women speakers at conferences, and it’s kind of an extension of the “women attending conferences”, “women in the industry”, “women studying computing” problems. The thing is, this is a point where &lt;strong&gt;we can actually make a difference&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’d be very difficult for most of us to effect change in education, but it’s much easier for us to get more women representing the industry at conferences. This could hopefully then encourage more women to attend conferences, which would lead to more women in the industry, women studying computing subjects etc, and the same goes for other minority groups. I don’t think many people would argue that this is a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;quotas-at-conferences-they-re-not-the-only-possible-solution&#34;&gt;Quotas at conferences, they’re not the only possible solution…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next big controversy is about how we can manage this. Without resorting to quotas or all women speakers reluctant to accept speaking invitations without wondering “am I only here because I’m a girl?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s currently a big problem with conference organisers who just aren’t that bothered about diversity in the industry. I can understand their hiding away from the issue, because actively trying to improve it is very very hard. There have been a &lt;a href=&#34;http://2012.jsconf.eu/2012/09/17/beating-the-odds-how-we-got-25-percent-women-speakers.html&#34;&gt;few posts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://geekfeminism.org/2012/05/21/how-i-got-50-women-speakers-at-my-tech-conference/&#34;&gt;written about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2012/11/solving-pipeline-problem.html&#34;&gt;how conferences have done this&lt;/a&gt;, but the main point is that organisers have been forced to look inside themselves and consider whether they pick their speakers objectively, without bias against minorities. Many organisers ask their friends to speak. It must be an awkward thing if you suddenly realise that, totally unintentionally, all your friends are white men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;examining-ourselves&#34;&gt;Examining ourselves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a problem because most people couldn’t possibly identify this in themselves, and then those that do wouldn’t want to admit it anyway. It’s difficult to understand that we (society) tend to favour white men in authority roles (such as speaking at conferences) because that’s what our culture has taught us to want. You don’t have to be a white man to feel this way towards white men in authority either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fighting-our-biases&#34;&gt;Fighting our biases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way to combat these biases (whether they’re known or unknown, and whether we acknowledge them or not) is to ask conference organisers to review their speaker selection process. Especially if it seems to result in featuring one type of person. Nothing more than that. Quotas don’t help, because that just results in “token” speakers, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/01/a-simple-suggestion-to-help-phase-out-all-male-panels-at-tech-conferences/266837/&#34;&gt;men pledging to not speak unless there’s a satisfactory representation of women&lt;/a&gt; is helpful, because it’s telling the organisers that diversity is important to them, and that you believe the current lineup isn’t representative of a fair speaker selection process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;acknowledging-what-s-going-on&#34;&gt;Acknowledging what’s going on&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not always a problem if organisers used a fair process and it still resulted in an all white male lineup. The important part is that they acknowledge there’s a problem and try to explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;. We all know that there’s not as many women in the industry as men, what we want to know is that people are trying to improve upon the situation, rather than promoting an environment where minorities don’t feel comfortable. Without even acknowledging that a problem exists, the imbalance in the industry will inevitably continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;standing-up&#34;&gt;Standing up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campaigning for diversity is the final controversy. It’s not a fun topic to discuss, and people are very easily hurt if they feel as though they’re being attacked or accused of gender discrimination. Unfortunately this results in all sorts of people reacting in ways that aim to shut up those who are trying to address the imbalance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Both men and women have said that men’s opinions on the matter aren’t as valid as women’s opinions. This is sad. While men may not have been able to experience the bias against women first-hand, that shouldn’t mean that they’re not allowed to fight for the equality that they believe in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great analogy from Martin Pilkington “…But you’re not allowed to speak out on women’s rights as you’re not a woman! Nor animal rights as you’re not a pigeon!” (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pilky/status/294468887246938115&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/pilky/status/294468887246938115&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. I’ve seen a few women on Twitter imply that it’s not a problem because they haven’t had bad experiences themselves. This is the camp I used to fall into. Because it wasn’t affecting me, I didn’t want to draw negative attention to myself. It’s ok if you haven’t experienced something and so you feel uncomfortable standing up for it, but to deny that something exists because it hasn’t affected you seems very self-centred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the one that I had feared for so long, and it finally happened to me a couple of weeks ago:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well she certainly wasn’t a ‘token girl’ at our second event, but she appears to want to be branded as one” (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/leydon/status/294457218114408448&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/leydon/status/294457218114408448&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best way to shut women up about equal rights is to suggest that they’re only doing it for selfish reasons.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;nobody-wants-to-be-the-token-speaker&#34;&gt;Nobody wants to be the token speaker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy speaking occasionally, but I’m really more of a fan of attending conferences. I don’t want token women speakers to exist, let alone have people suggest that I am one, and that I was only asked to speak to fulfil a quota.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;keeping-on-standing-up&#34;&gt;Keeping on standing up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still going to fight this one out, though. I want to make the industry a more diverse, interesting and inviting place, and I want to &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/a-loveletter/&#34; title=&#34;A loveletter&#34;&gt;set a good example for those that come after us&lt;/a&gt;. I know that I’m quite a confident person, and I feel like I’m in a better position to stand up for us than many others, and I don’t want to waste my opportunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

        I really like this article much. You mention the most valid points and problems we currently have (won’t limit that to our industry as this appears in many more industries the same way).

&lt;p&gt;Just to add one thing to your personal experience: I am sorry about this, this tweet is unnecessary. But as a male (it just doesn’t matter I want to say with that) speaker who is not known very much and new to speaking you get such comments regardless of your gender. I also got some very disappointing comments on some talks of me. I do think this is very unpleasant to people who speak because they want to share something. People are taking ones self-confidence with such statements.

Spoken for most speakers (I am assuming here) I don’t think they want to be speakers because they wanna be rock-stars but because they want to share something. Criticize them by just tweeting / writing such crappy statements just shows how poor-minded the person is who writes or says this.&lt;/p&gt;
btw: Can you set line-height in textarea back to normal? hard to write here ;-)

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;comment-entry&#34;&gt;
        Traditionally, I’ve always leaned towards the school of thought that says “The population is evenly split along gender lines, women are just as talented as men, therefore the number of women in the industry/on boards of directors/speaking at conferences should automatically balance themselves, without any need to do anything about it.” That works well enough in theory, but if, as seems to be the case, it isn’t balancing well, then I’m happy to do what I can to adjust the situation. For reasons that I don’t entirely understand, having not experienced them myself, (some) women seem to need, or at least appreciate, female role models. Therefore, it seems to me that for the tech industry (conference speakers etc) to balance properly, we first need to reach a critical mass of female role models. If this is something that can only be achieved by actively considering the gender of speakers, then so be it.

Regarding your point about male views not being as valid as female ones: I think a lot of men (myself included) feel that expressing opinions on this subject is a little bit like a rich MP talking about what life is like for the poor. Many of us would quite like to take more of a stand on the issue, but I think we need to be invited to do so by women first. Otherwise we feel like we’re barging in on a conversation of which we’re not currently a part.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Mark, please do speak up. We need all the good men like yourself to take a stand on this –; otherwise we’re too easily dismissed in some quarters as “those shrill women”. 

I agree with Amber that it’s easy to be insulated from this even as a woman. I’ve never been threatened or publicly insulted like many women I hear from. To be honest I’m fairly thick-skinned and when I’m aware of sexist behaviour towards myself, tend just to find it hilarious.

It’s something, as you can imagine, that Andy and I are grappling with with [Digpen](http://digpen.com&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow). Part of me can’t imagine anyone behaving like this at one of our conferences. I’m tempted to say that the atmosphere here in the South West is quite different, and we’re wary of making a big deal of “zero tolerance” in case that makes people think we *do* have a problem. At the same time, we want to make it clear that if there is ever this kind of behaviour at a Digpen event, or we hear of anyone treating our speakers badly (whatever their gender), we won’t stand for it.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        As you can imagine, Sophie, I’ve been thinking a lot about DigPen in this context, not least because it forms the bulk of my recent conference experience. I’ve certainly never witnessed any sexism there, and I wonder if that is down to the crowd or the history of the event. Obviously DigPen has never set out to be female-orientated, but between being founded by Frankie and now steered by you, it’s always had a strong female presence on the stage. I have two ideas about why this may have made a difference. 1) An event that has a strong female presence from the outset might be less likely to attract the sort of men who don’t respect and value women in technology, and 2) (more importantly) the presence of women standing on that stage from day one has provided exactly the sort of role model for women that I was talking about above. This may have given other women confidence to both attend and speak at the events, without worrying that they won’t be received well. Of course it could simply be that everyone connected to DigPen is just so damn lovely ;-)
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hi Laura,

I must say, I’m at a loss for words, partially because (kind of like yourself) I never *really* was exposed to any bad behaviour on conferences. But more importantly, and I cannot stress this enough, because I am stunned by the braveness you have to keep fighting despite the fact you’ve never had any real setback during conferences. Don’t get this the wrong way though, I’m sure nobody wants to be called out as a token, I’m sure, but I’ve seen people write crazy stuff on the internet as well, and yours seems still bareable compared to them. Yet, despite this, you still fight back, even if it was just to defend those whom are truely being bullied. Now that.. that’s a noble thing. It’s why I’m proud to know you.

Keep fighting Laura, we’re behind you ;)&lt;/p&gt;
PS Hope I didn’t say/write anything offensive here? Sorry if I did.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        You say “we all tend to favour white men in authority roles (such as speaking at conferences) because that’s what our society and culture has taught us to want” –; do you really believe this sweeping, generalisation of a statement?

        @mark As for me, I would not think of it along those lines –; some of my best friends are women, or gay, or have a disability. I live with a woman and a baby daughter. All these people are part of my life and are what shapes me. I would never deign to fight for their rights (apart from my son and daughter as they do not have a voice as yet). However I will fight for *my* right to be surrounded by diversity. I will fight for *my* right not to be surrounded by hatefulness, or labeled as hateful because my neighbour is.

        Hi Neil, that’s an interesting idea. I’d never thought about having a right to diversity around me. Kind of makes sense in a way though, if you accept the argument (as I do) that diversification results in an enriching experience.
        &lt;/div&gt;

        Thanks for sharing this.  You have some good insight about this. It’s just a shame that our community is filled with this crap.  We’re supposed to support one another, have passion for what we do and share it to grow the community.  These old-world views about gender have no place.  Lea Verou made a comment to me recently that she saw (in Europe, at least) that the southern part of Europe was more sexist than the northern part.  We have to put a kabash on ignorance and make it well known that the community won’t tolerate it.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Having started my first speaker bureau in 2004, I realised a number of years later that most of my speakers were male. Nothing wrong with that, except I found I was always shortlisting men. Only solution was to form a women’s speaker agency which I did. Voxy Lady Women’s Speaker Bureau. And..no I don’t discriminate I also represent men on my now re-branded original bureau. 

What amazes me the most about having a women’s speaker bureau is how many requests I get for my speakers to speak for FREE!!! And yes, even from corporations who could easily afford a speaker.  We don’t do free because our speakers are all seasoned professionals who need a fair exchange for their expertise.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Nice reading you’re taking a negative and making it into a positive, not just for your self, but also for people who would in a similar way feel left out.

Additionally, I am prepared to take one for the team, reviewing the appropriateness of the scantily clad women images.

&lt;p&gt;Best Regards,

 Peter&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;2012 has been a massive year for me. It was a year of saying yes to things that scared me. It was the first time I spoke at a conference (and &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/conferences/&#34; title=&#34;Conferences&#34;&gt;I went on to speak at a further seven events.&lt;/a&gt;) I found the first house I’ve lived in by myself. I travelled to as many countries in one year as I had done in my whole life so far. It was the end of a long relationship and a completely unexpected falling head-over-heels into a new one. And I got this tiny little puppy who didn’t just become enormous, but became one of the biggest and best things in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started writing a long post detailing each month and realised I have too many highlights and I’d be here all night. However this year was the year I started taking lots of photos. So I thought I’d share the few that mean the most to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals-for-2013&#34;&gt;Goals for 2013&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t make any goals this year, but seeing everyone commenting on theirs has inspired me to set some for 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep saying yes to things that scare me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a better balance of more client work and be more fussy about the conferences I attend (19 events in one year is too many!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be more efficient with my time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re the loose and achievable kind of goals I can get behind…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

Thx for that one.

      <description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-ve-changed-my-mind-about-this-subject&#34;&gt;I’ve changed my mind about this subject!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To read about why and how I don’t believe this anymore, &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/women-and-conferences/&#34; title=&#34;Women and conferences&#34;&gt;please read Women and conferences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;business-tech-conferences&#34;&gt;Business…Tech…Conferences…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every time&lt;/strong&gt; I hear these dreaded phrases, “*Women in business*”, “*Women in tech*”, “*Women at conferences*” I just groan. It’s really boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples. “*There’s only x% of women at this conference*” or “&lt;em&gt;There’s no female speakers at this conference&lt;/em&gt;.” Not just as observations (there’s nothing wrong in stating the obvious,) but saying it’s a negative point. I couldn’t care less how many other girls there are at a conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asides from it being a complete bonus when there’s no queue for the Ladies, I’d rather a conference was full of eager people who bought their tickets because they were interested and wanted to engage with other attendees. Would you rather there were 100% enthusiastic, participatory attendees or a conference where there was &lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; male/female attendees where 30% were just there to make up the numbers and weren’t bothered about being there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for speakers, maybe there are more male leaders (not exclusively, there are some brilliant female speakers) in the industry. The quality of a conference shouldn’t be compromised just in order to get some female speakers. Get the best speakers you can, and just don’t discriminate against having great women when they do emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I do understand people who are working for female equality. I appreciate it. I’m not really a feminist, as nowadays feminism seems to mean that men can’t say or do anything and women can act like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misandry&#34; title=&#34;Misandry on Wikipedia&#34;&gt;female-equivalent of chauvinists&lt;/a&gt; as they like (See &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_Women&#34; title=&#34;Loose Women on Wikipedia&#34;&gt;Loose Women&lt;/a&gt; and other embarrassing examples.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find being singled out as female isn’t the same as being equal. Reverse discrimination isn’t as positive as it often seems. Gender is completely irrelevant in the tech industry, certainly at conferences and definitely in business. We’re not talking about manual labour or track running here, where women and men are clearly different. Why should women be remarkable just for existing in these industries?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a designer, I don’t think my design work reflects my gender. Certainly cultural and environmental factors must impact on my work, but design work is about context. Design work reflects the context of the project and the context of the client. I don’t like pink because I’m female but I might use pink on a site if I think it’s appropriate. I don’t think you could tell I’m a girl just by looking at my work (though correct me if I’m wrong, because if you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; then I’m doing something wrong!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s issues with most industries being male or female-dominated. That’s not going to change overnight. But in the same way, I really can’t say that anything in business, tech or conferences have ever put me off being a part of it. There are so many factors affecting genders in work, be it education, culture, or actual discrimination. Let’s just get rid of the discrimination part, and when it’s not a problem, let’s not make it an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, let me be completely honest. If anybody talks about me as being a “woman in business”, a “woman in tech” or a “woman at a conference”, not only is it weird being referred to as a &lt;strong&gt;woman&lt;/strong&gt; (I’m not that old!) but I also find it pretty fucking patronising.&lt;/p&gt;

        I agree. It makes it seem like it’s especially hard for women to succeed in business, but really it’s down to the person, not their sex.

        @laurakalbag I always thought “this tech conferences has women” was a bit like clubs that let women in free, so that horny men will pay.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conferences-are-my-social-life&#34;&gt;Conferences are my social life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I go to more conferences, I meet more lovely people and get to see friends I’d only ever talk to on Twitter otherwise. In the last two years, I’ve been to about three a year and it feels about the right amount that you rarely see the same talk twice and it’s not just the same topics going round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I met loads of great people at New Adventures, but unfortunately missed more people than I meant to catch up with. It was such a packed-out venue that it was easy to lose people in the crowds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-location-and-venue&#34;&gt;The location and venue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take too long to get to Nottingham from Surrey. We were lucky that the motorways were reasonably clear and we spent most of our time trying to navigate Nottingham’s one way systems when we got there! It was good to go to a conference outside London but the resulting hotel and petrol costs for me (I can commute to London easily) made it almost as expensive as attending more expensive conferences in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The venue, Albert Hall, looked beautiful and made it easy to hear and see the speakers wherever you were sat. For me, the downside to the venue was that I was really cold for most of the day. I know I feel the cold more than most, but it was a bit uncomfortable sitting there in a scarf and gloves. Often conferences are warm environments due to the amount of people in one room so I admit I was probably under-prepared for the wintry day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-talks&#34;&gt;The talks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;twitter&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn’t any wi-fi at the conference, which was great because there were less faces hidden behind laptops (it’s really distracting when you’re sitting behind someone writing code!) However, this did mean there was less back channel discussion on Twitter, it was mostly people quoting favourite quotes. It was a bit of a shame as I like the back channel. It gives people the confidence to bring up issues and questions that they wouldn’t necessary ask the speakers in front of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made use of the 3G signal on my phone to make notes on Twitter about the conference, it’s the way I learn and helps me digest ideas (I’m a complete fidget.) I know I’m likely to irritate people by doing it, but a few said they liked to hear some of what was going on so I think it’s much more worthwhile than keeping it to myself. These notes, along with the great tweets from the brilliant &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/ubelly&#34; title=&#34;ubelly on Twitter&#34;&gt;@ubelly&lt;/a&gt;, helped me form some connections between the ideas and help me understand them better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;You might want to click the image to see it larger so you can read the really dinky text.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/dconstruct-2010/&#34; title=&#34;dConstruct 2010&#34;&gt;my notes on dConstruct&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to connect the different themes running through the talks as they made the day so much more than just random talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;running-themes&#34;&gt;Running themes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many of the talks felt as though they were revolving around connected themes. This made the day feel as though you were getting different sides of the story which suited the half hour slots which might have otherwise felt brief. Particular themes such as user experiences, emotional design, narratives and content-aware design made me feel very grown up. Much like dConstruct, it seems like the conference circuit is moving on from the slightly patronising show-and-tell and instructional talks to more inspiring, motivating and thoughtful discussions on how we can be better and make the industry move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-favourite-talk-the-new-language-of-web-design&#34;&gt;My favourite talk: The New Language of Web Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d say my favourite talk (though I enjoyed them all) of the day was &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/danrubin&#34; title=&#34;Dan Rubin on Twitter&#34;&gt;Dan Rubin&lt;/a&gt;‘s. The topics of language, communication and terms in the industry felt just right for the audience and the maturity of the conference. Dan is a consistently fantastic speaker and his was the one talk that really stood out as being the perfect amount of exploration into the subjects for the half hour slot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-ll-be-looking-out-for-new-adventures-next-year-8230&#34;&gt;I’ll be looking out for New Adventures next year&amp;#8230;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing can be sure, &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/colly&#34; title=&#34;Simon Collison on Twitter&#34;&gt;Simon Collison&lt;/a&gt; put on a great conference. There was a really friendly, we’re-all-in-it-together, casual atmosphere that was fun and in no way intimidating to new conference goers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a lot of the bigger conferences are becoming more expensive with little added value, less expensive conferences like New Adventures are in competition to provide a great time at a freelancer’s price tag. It definitely achieved that, feeling like a premium conference on a very affordable budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s a New Adventures next year, I’ll definitely try to be there.&lt;/p&gt;
