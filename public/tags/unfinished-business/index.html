	The latest Unfinished Business podcast has just been published, and I’m on it again! I had a lovely time talking to Andy about scheduling projects, invoicing, rates and people who don’t understand copyright.
A very big thank you to my friend Jo who let me take over her internet and bedroom for the recording, as our internet is still terrible! <a href="/unfinished-business-54/">Read Unfinished Business #54</a>.

	Last week I was on Unfinished Business again! Andy and I talked about hosting workshops, business names and how to make a good impression via email. My audio is pretty awful, and I’m sorry for that. I tried to be all clever with my headset, but ended up sounding very small and faraway…
I’m also going to be on Unfinished Business more regularly. I always have fun chatting to Andy, and it’s a great excuse to pick his more experienced brains about business stuff. <a href="/unfinished-business-44/">Read Unfinished Business #44</a>.

	I know, this is a funny topic on which to base a blog post but I love the Unfinished Business podcast, and I’d like to elaborate why in something more than a few fawning tweets.
Business, but not suits Business doesn’t feel like the right word to describe what I do. It’s a hobby that makes me enough money to support myself. The word ‘business’ conjures up images of suits, handshakes and networking. <a href="/why-i-love-unfinished-business/">Read Why I love Unfinished Business</a>.
