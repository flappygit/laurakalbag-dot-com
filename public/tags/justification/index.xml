      <title>Really, a redesign? This can’t be real…</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-s-about-time&#34;&gt;It’s about time…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So finally I’ve redesigned my website. It’s been about three and a half years since the last version of laurakalbag.wpengine.com (still around at &lt;a href=&#34;http://2009.laurakalbag.wpengine.com&#34;&gt;http://2009.laurakalbag.wpengine.com&lt;/a&gt;) and that’s a site I designed before I finished university, before I even started freelancing full time. To be fair, it took a while for me to hate it (not that usual kind of as-soon-as-it’s-launched-I-hate-it problem us designers often have) but that’s far too long for a portfolio site to be hanging around. Since then we’ve had a huge shift to mobile design, then web fonts, then responsive design, and I wasn’t practicing what I was preaching on my own site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d done a little update when I got hold of a Typekit account, got some fancy fonts on there, which temporarily quenched my thirst for a redesign, but it was downhill from there. I kept updating the portfolio in the hope that people would see it for the work, not the site, and I added a WordPress blog with a default theme to house my ramblings, albeit in a brandless design. Then I starting being embarrassed about it, the grunge textures and simplified layout. So I had the genius idea that I’d stop updating it. If I did that then I’d be bound to redesign it so I could add more projects…but no, a lack of time and inspiration left the site stagnating for nearly another year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;designing-for-yourself-is-really-hard&#34;&gt;Designing for yourself is really hard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing. I’m a client designer. I love the challenges and variety brought to me by clients, and working on new projects, and at that distance it’s much easier to understand how to best represent them. Designing for yourself is completely different. You want to accurately portray yourself and you want a site that showcases what you do. That’s pretty intimidating in an industry where your friends will judge every pixel!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-ideas&#34;&gt;My ideas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggled with the idea that I needed to showcase work. In theory, the best way to do that is to have a very neutral, simple design where the work does the talking. The problem is, a very clean and minimal site could never accurately represent &lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt;. I love colour and decoration and striking design. I had to find a way to balance the two. I had this little idea where each page would be themed to fit the colours of the project (or subject of the blog post.) This would result in a site that had a huge variety of strong colour. I knew that this meant I had to reign in the other design elements (typography, layout, texture, shapes), making them simple and letting the colour show through without seeming too overwhelming. Whether I’ve achieved this, I’m still not sure…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;and-of-course-it-s-not-perfect&#34;&gt;And of course it’s not perfect&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I started the redesign process, I knew that I’d have to let go early on. To be fair, I’m used to doing this on client projects; you can’t be fiddling around perfecting every pixel forever. There’s not enough time or money in the world to pay for that. So there will be parts of this site that are a bit wonky around the edges. There’s some dodgy hover styles and a half-baked attempt at retina support that I’d like to improve upon, but I fancied that I could iterate upon these things once they’re live, and benefit from the wisdom of my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;now-to-get-on-with-it&#34;&gt;Now to get on with it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on forever about my decisions and choices and ifbutsmaybes so I’ll cut it short here. I might write some more posts about the design at some point, but I wouldn’t want to bore you to death…&lt;/p&gt;

        Very nice Laura, certainly gets across a lot of your personality starting with the typeface and then on to the illustrations and colours! It’s great, and everything you’ve written is so honest and upfront.

If I were to make comment it would be I’m never keen on underlined links (if you need to underline, use `border-bottom` so you don’t interfere with descenders).

Also, your (amazing) work doesn’t seem to take centre stage! Perhaps that’s what you wanted, but it’s like the 5th link on your navigation? I’d bring it to the fore and make your screenshots larger, and maybe cross-sell between sections a bit.

Other than that, awesome :)
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;comment-entry&#34;&gt;
        Thanks Matt! Funnily enough, I used to always use border-bottom for exactly that reason, but eventually I found it too distracting having lines hanging so far away from the main shape of the characters. It took away that skimmable uniformity.

You’re very kind about my work, and I really appreciate the constructive criticism. I did think hard about how I wanted to represent myself, and really my primary goal for the site was to be as useful as possible for potential clients. Of course I want to be judged on my previous work, but I think it’s important that I provide other information about the kind of designer I am and what I’m like to work with.
        &lt;/div&gt;

        I know I said yesterday, but you’ve done a bloody good job with this. You should be dead proud of yourself, and you’ve inspired me to maybe finally get round to finishing mine off too!

&amp;#8230;after I’ve helped you with that jQuery, of course ;)

        &lt;p&gt;Hey Laura

I was wondering why you didn’t just tweak the original site instead of a full redesign? Not that I dont like the new one, its pretty cool :)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;comment-entry&#34;&gt;
        There was too much I wanted to change. The way I’d configured WordPress before was quite awkward to maintain (there was a lot of HTML required when adding new projects) and I wanted to make use of the newer CMS-like features that WordPress offered (like custom post types and custom taxonomies.) Also, when designing a responsive site, it’s much cleaner to rewrite from mobile CSS first which would have meant refactoring **all** the markup!

And then there’s the fact that I was just sick of the old design. I know this one isn’t exactly ‘modern’, but the old version was definitely ‘old school’… ;)
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

        Looks great. I agree that you should move your work to the forefront, however. Clients, or at least the ones I’ve worked with, can tell a lot about you by the work you do –; not necessarily a block of text about you. 

Just a thought. :)

        Glad to see it finally live Laura –; as I said on Twitter, amazing work. Really love the eye to detail you have put into this, and having known you for a while now, I really feel your personally comes through.

It’s never easy working on your own website, and you can spend every hour under and over the sun tweaking it, but like you said, it is live and it works (beautifully). Now you can tweak and iterate when the time arises.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Really like the new design, Laura. Especially impressed with your texts. I always struggle to have my text reflect my way of working and thinking, so I end up deleting it and still have the old gibberish on my site (that I haven’t touched in over a year). It’s like you said so hard to design and develop for yourself.

So you should be really proud of this site, it looks and feels super!

Cheers,

Michael

        I really like the simplicity of the design and absolutely love all the colors! If your personality is anything like your picture (cheerful &amp;amp; smiley), then your personality shines throughout this site and through your writing. Keep up the awesome work!
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Thank you for this post! I too, have been neglecting my own site, I even took my whole old site down and just put a “I am working on my site” temporary page, but that still wasn’t enough motivation. I am still stuck between 0 and 1.  You totally verbalized what I think some of my blocks are, and it was really nice to feel like other designers struggle in some of the same ways I do. I think it’s hard when you take doing good work seriously.  Your site is awesome, great work.  You have inspired me to get to work, maybe :)
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Design work is 50% visual, 50% justification</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;After I finished my last post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/design-tips-for-developers/&#34;&gt;Design Tips for Developers&lt;/a&gt;, it really struck me how much I wrote to justify my design. I wasn’t just writing tips saying “*do this, it’s good*“, “*don’t do this, it’s bad.*” I put time and effort into explaining why I made these decisions and why I didn’t do it another way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I send a design to a client via e-mail, I usually spend around 45 minutes –; 1 hour writing an accompanying ‘justification’. I really have no idea if I’m the only one that does this? I assume not. I know a lot of people don’t, they just send static images. Does this mean it’s not worthwhile?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-do-justifications&#34;&gt;How I do justifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an excerpt from my last post, giving a classic example of how I write justifications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve limited the ‘Latest Happenings’ to only five events on my design. My reasoning being that if you have many more than that, they’re not really ‘latest’ anymore. This way we can ensure that the amount of happenings are well-balanced with the content on the left side of the page. Although the ‘What is Lift?’ content is liable to changing, I imagine that it wouldn’t increase too much more in length, as any further information and you’re going into the depths of documentation that probably isn’t suitable for a home page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to cover all the basics of the design. I explain my choices regarding layout, typography, colour and imagery. I summarise any other methods or angles I tried that didn’t work, and explain why I thought they didn’t work. If I’m not actually sure why I did something on impulse, I’ll really think about it, analyse my decision and explain it to the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-write-justifications&#34;&gt;Why I write justifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#### Not all design work can speak for itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clients aren’t design specialists so you can’t expect them to ‘get’ your thinking behind a design just by looking at it (And you probably couldn’t expect most other designers to ‘get’ it either!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#### I don’t often get to speak to the client in person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fairly easy to quickly summarise your design when you can look at a person’s face and see if they understand you. When you’re lacking face-to-face communication, you really have to make up for it in writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#### Even if I do see a client face-to-face, I’ll often forget something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting down and writing a proper explanation helps me look over the design from top to bottom and take it apart. It also takes a while for a client to mull over a design. They might be unsure of part of it later on at home. Having your justification there to reassure them can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-was-also-taught-how&#34;&gt;I was also taught how&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every now and again I realise the huge value in being taught art and graphics at school, college and university. From secondary school art lessons onwards, one-third of the work was research, one-third was the practical application and the final third was evaluation. Even if the rest of the work wasn’t perfect, if the evaluation was good then you’d be on to a winner. It wasn’t about being skilled with a pencil or paintbrush, it was about being able to reflect, evaluate and actually understand what you were trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;being-able-to-give-a-reason&#34;&gt;Being able to give a reason&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe a huge part of your ability as a designer is understanding why you do what you do. In order to create an appropriate and usable design, you’ve got to be able to do better than ‘pretty.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a designer &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be able to tell a client the reasoning behind their design decisions. There’s nothing worse than the ‘professional’ who says “&lt;em&gt;I like it best like this and I’m the professional so you should respect my opinion&lt;/em&gt;.” Of course, everybody has their own preferences, theories and leanings, but if you can’t come up with a reason beyond “I like it” or “everybody’s doing it”, then what service are you actually providing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;value-for-a-client&#34;&gt;Value for a client&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading a description about your design decisions lets a client know you’ve really thought their design through. I’m hoping I show my clients that I spend a long time considering my design work and trying to make something that will work for them. When you’re providing a service, rather than a physical product, it’s good to remind people that you’re good value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;value-for-a-designer&#34;&gt;Value for a designer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sending a justification I find there are fewer arguments. Full stop. As I’ve got better at writing them, I’ve found more clients agree with my decisions. I hope I’m also improving as a designer, but it’s also incredibly difficult to disagree with a design element when someone has given you a very good logical reason why it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t get “make my logo bigger”, “can you do another version?” or “I want it in Papyrus”. I know I’m fantastically fortunate to work with lovely people, but I reckon explaining yourself (and maybe being a bit persuasive) might also have something to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
