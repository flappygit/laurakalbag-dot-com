      <description>When Andy Clarke challenged me to the “Give and Tell Challenge”, I was very happy to comply. Dan James, inspired by the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, came up with the challenge:
 You donate to a cause, or causes, that have meaning to you and you say why. You then challenge 3 other people to do the same thing.
 All Out I have just donated to All Out. All Out campaigns for a world where no person will have to sacrifice their family or freedom, safety or dignity, because of who they are or who they love.</description>

      <description>I’ve changed my mind about this subject! To read about why and how I don’t believe this anymore, please read Women and conferences.
Business…Tech…Conferences… Every time I hear these dreaded phrases, “*Women in business*”, “*Women in tech*”, “*Women at conferences*” I just groan. It’s really boring.
Examples. “*There’s only x% of women at this conference*” or “There’s no female speakers at this conference.” Not just as observations (there’s nothing wrong in stating the obvious,) but saying it’s a negative point.</description>
