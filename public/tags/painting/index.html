		A strange thing has happened in the last week. I’ve been a bit blue, but I’ve really got into my One Sketch A Day book. This was a lovely little book that Rachel Shillcock sent me.
 
I started on the 12th December last year, with a quick sketch. I tried really hard and 9 days filled out with quick-ish sketches. The most detailed was the Fringe-style seahorse I drew the day after we finished watching the Fringe finale. <a href="/sketch-of-the-day/">Read Sketch of the day</a>.

		I’ve always been a kind-of arty person. I took Art at school, did an Art Foundation and a Graphics degree. I totally loved art when I was small, but as I’ve got older, and more technology and web-obsessed, a lot of the old media went a bit out of the window.
Though I was still loving wireframing and taking notes by hand, I just threw all the paints out in frustration at how slow and difficult they were. <a href="/autodesk-sketchbook-pro/">Read Autodesk SketchBook Pro</a>.
