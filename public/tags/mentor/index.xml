&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/mentoring-the-project/&#34; title=&#34;Mentoring a project: the project&#34;&gt;Mentoring a project: the project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been far too long since I wrote about the mentoring project. I’ve been incredibly busy and really needed to dedicate more time to make it a success (more about that in another post!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time I wrote about the project, we had just started to get the contract sorted. I use an evolved version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/contract-killer/&#34;&gt;Andy Clarke’s Contract Killer&lt;/a&gt; for my client projects. Over the last four years I’ve amended it, and added in extra chunks, to prevent myself from repeating the same mistakes on multiple projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reused this contract again for this project, adding in some extra text about my responsibility as a mentor to the client and mentees. We then decided, prompted by the client’s desire to potentially share the code with other community projects, and Yago’s knowledge of &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/&#34;&gt;Creative Commons licenses&lt;/a&gt;, to license the code under the &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/&#34;&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;licensing-code&#34;&gt;Licensing code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting and important part of the contract, and merits discussion. Previously I had always used the Contract Killer’s lines about licensing where the client has all the rights to the graphics/design elements, whereas the developer has the rights to the code and licenses it to the client for one use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This always seemed to make sense to me before, it restricts the client from rehashing your code for a different project, or even reselling it to others. But code is not a static one-off document. A website, and subsequently its code, is a living document which is usually frequently updated, fixed and improved upon. How does this then work with a one-use license? Are we then telling clients that if they need any code to be changed, they must re-hire us for the job? This wouldn’t work for most client-developer relationships. As an industry, we seem to have mostly moved to a model where we give clients the tools and knowledge to keep their own sites updated. Maintenance contracts are a thing of the past for all but the most complex systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yago found the perfect license for our particular case, where we wanted to allow the client to share the work on a not-for-profit basis, but I do urge you to &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/choose/&#34; title=&#34;choose a Creative Commons license&#34;&gt;look into the correct license which &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; makes it clear what the client is and isn’t allowed to do&lt;/a&gt;. And the wonderful thing about Creative Commons is that they write the licenses in plain English. This means the licenses work with the Contract Killer, and also makes it easy to find the best license for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-all-takes-time&#34;&gt;It all takes time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorting out the contract took a lot more time than I’d have liked. When so many parties need to sign a contract, it can take a lot of to-ing and fro-ing before it’s agreed upon. Add in email-based communication and people working on the project part-time, and it took us a good couple of weeks to get it all ironed out. Far too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://rightsignature.com/&#34;&gt;Right Signature&lt;/a&gt; to get documents signed online, and I was jumping into it too quickly. It’s fairly quick to email a PDF (or even better, pasted text) of the contract for all the signers glance over before they need to sign. As fantastic as &lt;a href=&#34;https://rightsignature.com/features&#34; title=&#34;features of Right Signature&#34;&gt;Right Signature’s sequential signers option&lt;/a&gt; is, it’s a complete pain if you get to the last person to sign the contract and they need to make an amendment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-the-contract&#34;&gt;After the contract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the contract was signed, having roles within the project actually become useful. Whilst I expected Yago, Sibylle and Phil to work as hybrids, collaborating on design and development, their responsibilities to lead on front-end development, content and WordPress and design (respectively) meant each could be responsible for planning more in-depth requirements for that area. These requirements took a while to nail down but provided a structure to work from, and gave each mentee a better idea of what the others were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;one-comment&#34;&gt;One comment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol class=&#34;commentlist&#34;&gt;
    &lt;li class=&#34;comment even thread-even depth-1&#34; id=&#34;li-comment-541&#34;&gt;

                &lt;aside class=&#34;comment-meta commentmetadata&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#comment-541&#34;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&#34;2013-05-08T11:46:32+00:00&#34; pubdate class=&#34;published&#34;&gt;
         at &lt;span class=&#34;hours&#34;&gt;11:46am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/aside&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;comment-entry&#34;&gt;
        When it comes to licenses for code, I see nothing wrong with the old standards: the GNU General Public License, and the GNU Lesser GPL. Particularly when working with WordPress, where plugin and theme code is meant to be GPL compatible, using the GPL just makes sense. Yes, it does mean that the client could turn around and re-use, re-sell or whatever, the code. But considering that your name should be clearly identified anyway (in the license block at the top of each file), it will be obvious who to turn to to fix any issues. 

Moreover, by using a license that permits re-use, modification, etc., you are clearly saying, “I am not locking you in to my services, if you’re not happy, you can go else where with no problem; I’ll try and keep you happy”. And I think that’s valuable in and of itself.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I was guest co-host on &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/why-i-love-unfinished-business/&#34; title=&#34;Why I love Unfinished Business&#34;&gt;one of my most favourite podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz/12&#34;&gt;Unfinished Business&lt;/a&gt;. It was great to ramble and rant with Andy for 90 minutes as it’s not often I get to chat for so long to another designer whose main focus is client work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked about smoking chimps, mentoring and how we can try to help newcomers in the community, tools and techniques for dealing with client feedback, egos and constructive criticism among many other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous posts, I mentioned that I was going to explain the details of the project later on. This was because I didn’t want to get bogged down by the details of the brief while I was focusing on finding the right team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’ve got our team together, I can elaborate on our client and the brief. I was very lucky to be contacted by the lovely &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mallenbaker.net/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&#34;&gt;Mallen Baker&lt;/a&gt;, who had a great project in mind and was willing to give me, and the mentees I chose, a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gislingham-village-website&#34;&gt;Gislingham village website&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gislingham is a rural village in Suffolk which has a thriving community with a number of local organisations and businesses. The village website is to be revamped to be able to provide an excellent online support to that community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://gislingham.com&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&#34;&gt;http://gislingham.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website is an old site, using now outdated development techniques (tables!) created by Mallen around ten years ago. Whilst the site has been maintained and updated, it’s in need of a redesign to help it better serve the local community. We are at two distinct advantages here. The existing website means that we can learn from what does and doesn’t work on the existing site. Also, having a client who works in the web industry gives us the advantage that we won’t have to teach the client about the web as we work on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-first-client-meeting&#34;&gt;Our first client meeting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mallen was keen to meet Phil, Yago and Sibylle, and it was a good opportunity to kick the project off. We met last Friday in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparation for our first meeting, the mentees dissected the brief and assembled a list of questions for the client. They each made their own lists and then collated these together in a master list which covered a huge range of detail and depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yago, Sibylle and Phil explored tools and file formats that everybody could use together without causing compatibility issues, wrote a very thorough content inventory and started looking at personas based on the brief and existing users, and researched project management systems at length to find one that was best suited to us, settling on Basecamp. This meant that we had somewhere to keep our discussions as all the email was becoming unruly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-meeting&#34;&gt;The meeting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to stay out the way in the meeting. All of the preparation and research that the mentees had done assured me that they were very capable running the meeting. I tried to only jump in when I thought something might be overlooked (rarely) and to assure them the role I would take for the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mallen started by explaining more background on the project and what he was looking for in the new site. This informal start already answered a lot of the questions that the mentees had prepared and helped us get to know Mallen better. Then the mentees ran through the list of questions they had, asking any other questions they came up with as they thought of them. This was exactly what I was hoping would happen. Everybody was comfortable enough to ask questions at any point but we didn’t all end up speaking over each other either!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;money&#34;&gt;Money&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end, I went over how I thought the project should be run, and we talked about money. I’ve been getting better at discussing money with clients, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&#34;&gt;listening to Andy and Anna on Unfinished Business&lt;/a&gt; has given me more confidence and reassurance that this is the best way to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want the project to be run as much as possible like I would run a client project myself. This means taking payment in stages, not just in one lump sum. Over the last six months I’ve successfully moved my clients to a structure where I bill 50% of the estimated project as a deposit/retainer, then bill every first and third Thursday of the month (pretty much every two weeks) to ensure a sensible cash flow and that nobody has to wait for, or pay, enormous invoices at the end of a long project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mimicking this process, we decided that, as we’re looking at a nominal payment of £500, breaking it into less than two stages would become a little too much of an admin nightmare. I will have to take the payment, and then pass it on to each mentee. If this got down to sending £10 payments around, it would be more hassle than it was worth. So we decided on a 50% up front and 50% on completion (the details of which will be ironed out in the contract).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-next-steps&#34;&gt;The next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we kick off the project, the mentees are going to assemble a proposal/estimate where they break down what needs doing and how long each task should take. This will help us plan how best to run the project and work out if our deadline is realistic. My next step is sorting out a contract for all of us to sign to make sure we understand our roles and responsibilities over the next couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;

        I really love this project you’re doing. It’s a great idea and can provide some great experience for those you selected. It’s great of you to share and help them. Mentoring can be invaluable. 

I’m really interested to follow along and see how it plays out.
    &lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Mentoring a project: finding the right people</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/mentoring-a-project-finding-the-right-people/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got a project! I’ll elaborate on the details of the project in a future post, but the importance of having a project was that it’s allowed me to choose the designers/developers who could get something out of being &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentee&#34;&gt;mentees&lt;/a&gt;. I didn’t want to do this before securing the right project as I needed to know what I was looking for in a mentee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-the-right-mentee-for-the-job&#34;&gt;Finding the right mentee for the job&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever had to make. After my idea &lt;a href=&#34;http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/thoughts-on-mentoring&#34;&gt;gained significant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz/4&#34;&gt;(kind) exposure&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve also felt the pressure to make sure I get it right. What’s made it even harder is that every designer/developer that sent me an email about the project was sweet, enthusiastic and incredibly willing. I had thirty-two candidates and no idea how best to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;shortlisting&#34;&gt;Shortlisting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-on&#34;&gt;Early on&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;payment&#34;&gt;Payment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cut down into short list whilst I was looking into the original project idea. I knew that it wouldn’t be a high-paying project; I wanted the majority of the value to be in the learning experience, and I made that clear in my first email to everyone who had contacted me. This meant a couple of candidates who were already serious freelancers, looking for a well-paid project, withdrew themselves. It’s always good to talk money up front! A few people didn’t reply at all, and that was fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-stage&#34;&gt;First stage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;team-work&#34;&gt;Team work&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I needed to work out the best way to eventually reduce my list of now thirteen to just a few. I was wary that nobody could take on a low-paying project, dedicate a huge amount of time to it and deliver great results; I asked which candidates were willing to work in small teams. As I knew all the candidates already had other work or studies, I thought it unrealistic to expect one person to do all the work. It would also require a hybrid designer-developer who was capable in front-end and back-end development. Now these people are rare in the industry, and would be almost impossible to find in anyone just starting out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made my short list even shorter. There were a few people who would prefer to work solo and so this project wouldn’t be the right match for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;specialism&#34;&gt;Specialism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this first stage I also asked whether the candidates preferred to work in design, front-end development, back-end development, or a combination of two or three skill areas. I was concerned I might end up with a surplus of one skill area, but actually it was a fairly even spread of all three, with most expressing interest in at least two areas. Hoorah for hybrids!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;enthusiasm-vs-talent&#34;&gt;Enthusiasm vs talent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I was keen to emphasise at this point was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;interest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in skill areas, not experience and not ability. If I’m asking to mentor people who are starting out in the industry, I can’t possibly expect them to have a wealth of experience in all the relevant areas. And those areas that they do have experience in may not be those they enjoy. Likewise, I can’t expect anyone to be fully proficient in their skill of choice. I can always advise them the best place to learn relevant new knowledge. All I need is for them to know the basics and &lt;strong&gt;really want&lt;/strong&gt; to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;favourite-work&#34;&gt;Favourite work&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly typical interview-style question. You could ask someone what their “best” piece of work was, and you may get their favourite piece of work, but you’re equally likely to get their most technically-proficient piece of work, or that which they think is most impressive, even if they hated the project and don’t like the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I asked for the candidate’s favourite project and why it was their favourite. I think this got me more of an insight into what they really cared about, and what holds the most value for them in a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;too-early-for-this-information&#34;&gt;Too early for this information&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst it was good to know I had an even coverage of skill areas at this stage, and what their favourite project was, it was too soon to use this information. Without knowing the project we were going to work on, how was I to judge how well the project would suit them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;second-stage&#34;&gt;Second stage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I knew what the project was going to be, there was more purpose in my questions. I sent another email to the remaining eight candidates. At this point I became sure that I was looking for three mentees to work as a team. I thought that this wouldn’t be too many people to make communication difficult, but enough to cope with the project in a way that would give them time to enjoy what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;still-interested&#34;&gt;Still interested?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked again if they were still interested. I wanted to make sure nobody felt like they’d committed to the project just through expressing their interest over a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;wordpress-experience&#34;&gt;WordPress experience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our project brief states that the website needs to be based on WordPress. Without going too much into the project or client (yet!) I knew that this was an appropriate solution for the project, so I really needed to find at least one candidate with some WordPress experience to lead that part of the development. Everybody showed willingness to learn even if they didn’t have any experience (love them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;blogging-the-process&#34;&gt;Blogging the process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After realising that a lot of people were talking about the project on Twitter, and I’d promised to blog about it, I realised that I’d have to make sure that any mentees were happy with me doing this, and trusted me to do the right thing. So, lastly I asked if they were happy with me writing about them. I emphasised that this wasn’t really about me picking the right match, I was just wondering how much to blog and how much to mention them. Obviously I would never post anything that just pointed out flaws in somebody’s work, but if we learn from our mistakes through constructive criticism, I think that’s a positive experience that we can collectively share and use to help other people learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody was happy with me blogging; I was starting to worry as their supportiveness was making it harder to choose!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;third-stage&#34;&gt;Third stage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I was desperately trying to work out the best ways to narrow down the list. I decided that it would be most sensible to ask what everybody’s weekly availability was, and which timezones/locations they were based in. I was fully expecting remote working, but it was important that the mentees were able to work together in a team and communicate easily. This helped me find three people whose availability suited each other, and whose skills complemented each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-final-decision&#34;&gt;The final decision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I didn’t anticipate was deciding that a couple of candidates were over-qualified for working in these teams. Looking at their experience, I was concerned that if they worked in a team, they would end up picking up too much of the slack because they had a significantly broader knowledge in web design and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dream-team&#34;&gt;The dream team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got my team down to the following three:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sibweber&#34;&gt;Sibylle&lt;/a&gt; –; Lead on WordPress and Content Strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/yagohimself&#34;&gt;Yago&lt;/a&gt; –; Lead on Front-end Development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/philippickering&#34;&gt;Phil&lt;/a&gt; –; Lead on Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit to team work would be that roles needn’t be fixed,  I expect the team to work together as closely as possible. Still, I thought I’d recommend that each mentee has their area to lead so they know how valuable they are to the project’s success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;onwards&#34;&gt;Onwards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we will have our first client meeting and get started on the project. I’ll have another update then.&lt;/p&gt;

thanks for this write-up –; nice to read about how you made your decision, bet it wasn’t an easy task :) Curious to follow this project now and see how it will work out—good luck to you all :)&lt;/p&gt;
*PS: from my perspective as their tutor, I am so very happy that your final selection included Yago and Sibylle ~ they’re both lovely as well as talented and will contribute some great work ;)*

        I think this is a really wonderful thing that you are doing, Laura. In order to make the future of the Web better, we need to start with the people. One of my goals for this year is to find a mentor as well. I realize that I have many areas that I need to improve, but I also believe I have a lot to offer to the right team somewhere. 

I look forward to seeing how your mentees progress over the coming weeks and months. Keep making the web a better place. :)
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Laura, 

This is such an inspiring thing to do, made me consider how I might go about mentoring more people and helping them build skills. Looking forward to seeing this work and how we can all help usher in new designers and developers onto the web.
    &lt;/div&gt;

Can’t wait to see how it turns out, it’s such a nice thing to do for folks.

      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/the-east-wing-podcast/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was a guest on &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/ttimsmith&#34;&gt;Tim Smith&lt;/a&gt;‘s &lt;a href=&#34;http://theeastwing.net/&#34;&gt;The East Wing podcast&lt;/a&gt;. It was a pre-recorded conversation and it was great fun. You can &lt;a href=&#34;http://theeastwing.net/episodes/laura-kalbag&#34;&gt;listen to it on the East Wing website&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll be up on iTunes soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed how I got started in the industry (really sorry traditional Graphic Design people, I may have generalised a bit…), speaking at conferences, women in the industry and mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/laurakalbag/status/298862630506991616&#34;&gt;I said last night on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Tim Smith is such a great guy. I really had my heart warmed and faith in humanity boosted by our conversation. His thoughts on women in the industry made me proud to be part of the web community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you don’t already &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-east-wing/id503801143?mt=2&#34;&gt;subscribe to The East Wing podcast&lt;/a&gt;, do it! It’s full of great, and inspiring, insight on the people behind the work in the web industry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mentoring a project: the right project</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/mentoring-a-project-the-right-project/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2013 15:59:34 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/mentoring-a-project-the-right-project/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This post is an update on &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/mentoring-a-project-the-idea/&#34; title=&#34;Mentoring a project: The idea&#34;&gt;my mentoring project idea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-the-right-project&#34;&gt;Finding the right project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you follow me on Twitter, you might have seen that I’m now looking for a different project to work on. Whilst the previous project I had in mind would have been great fun, the client had a very tight deadline. I didn’t want to push that pressure on to students and freelancers who are likely to have other work they need to do in order to pass their studies or pay the bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s that typical situation where the client can have it two of three ways “fast, cheap, good quality.” Working on a project that doesn’t allow time for good quality isn’t going to help anyone get worthwhile experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-would-be-the-right-project&#34;&gt;What would be the right project?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to think about what would make the ideal project in this kind of situation. This is what I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 13px;&#34;&gt;A website project where the end goal would be to launch the site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new website or a complete redesign, so new ideas can be generated and developed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A project where every element (design, development, hosting) is entirely in the freelancer’s hands, so they can get a wide experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A project with one or two stakeholders (clients) so that communication is fairly straight-forward (but still of utmost importance!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A modest budget. I want everyone to gain something, so there may not be a huge budget for the project, but I want there to be &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; budget. Of course, the experience is supposed to be the valuable part of this project, but I wouldn’t work for free so I wouldn’t encourage anyone else to do it either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-you-have-a-project-that-we-could-use&#34;&gt;Do you have a project that we could use?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means I’m now looking for a more suitable project. If you’re in need of a small(ish) website, and don’t have the budget for a fulltime professional web designer or developer, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/contact-me/&#34; title=&#34;Contact Me&#34;&gt;get in touch with me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-comments&#34;&gt;2 comments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol class=&#34;commentlist&#34;&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Mentoring a project: the idea</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/mentoring-a-project-the-idea/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2013 09:31:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/mentoring-a-project-the-idea/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, a potential project turned up in my inbox. An old school friend wants a website, needs it soon and doesn’t have a huge budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;me-and-freelancing&#34;&gt;Me and freelancing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m lucky, I get offered a lot of projects, and usually I don’t have any availability for a few months. Little projects like this generally can’t pay the bills for me. It’s a lot of time (particularly admin) for a fairly small return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a very small list of trusted designers that I’ll happily pass these projects. The thing is, when I do this, it’s a risk for me too. If I recommend someone who turns out to be unreliable, it makes me look bad too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-inspiration&#34;&gt;The inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After listening to &lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz/&#34;&gt;Unfinished Business&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz/#presenters&#34;&gt;Anna Debenham and Andy Clarke&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve been inspired to be more open about how I work. I’ve never been one to keep secrets, I’m always happy to discuss my rates and how I work with anyone, but I’ve never actively shared this information. And after talking to loads of students recently, I’ve realised that one of the hardest things, after landing a project in the first place, is knowing how to run a project and talk to clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-idea&#34;&gt;The idea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These thoughts and this project collided in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to help “de-mystify” these elements of freelancing. I wouldn’t call myself an expert, I’m not sure many people could. But after around four years of freelancing, I feel like I am &lt;em&gt;successful&lt;/em&gt;; I make enough money to support myself, living and working by myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that the transition from student to freelancer is particularly hard, and so I’m looking for students/graduates/new freelancers to work on this project. Here’s the tweet that I sent out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/laurakalbag/status/296305016954834944&#34;&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;
I’ve already had more than twenty replies, my next goal is to make sure I find one or two people who can gain as much as possible from this project. If you’re interested, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/contact-me/&#34; title=&#34;Contact Me&#34;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll hopefully be sending out an email to everyone who’s interested later on today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping to blog the process as much as possible, so other people can share in our experience. My next post will cover how I’m going to try to find a good match to work on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-comments&#34;&gt;8 comments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol class=&#34;commentlist&#34;&gt;

Best of luck to all the other candidates :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Laura :)

just wanted to repeat that I think this is such a brilliant idea, one which all parties will benefit from for sure :)

Working with real clients is something that teaches so much, having a mentor / expert at hand to run to for help and advise is invaluable. As a student or newcomer to the field, it is often scary—though it does not need to be.

This is one of the reasons why I get my students to work with a [ real client project ](http://webeyedea.info/wp/real-client-sites/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow) during my course. Tends to be quite time-consuming for me, to manage it all (number of students = number of clients)—but… **it is really worth it**: happy, grateful clients &amp;amp; happy, more informed newbies &amp;amp; one happy tutor :-)&lt;/p&gt;
Your idea of doing this is fabulous –; hope you will find a good match :) and really hope this will inspire more web peeps to follow suit :)
    &lt;/div&gt;

        This is fantastic, Laura. If only more folks in more fields applied this kind of attitude. Imagine how awesome we would all be?

        This is a great idea Laura. I’ve had a couple of &lt;i&gt;“those”&lt;/i&gt; kind of job requests recently and this seems a much more constructive approach than taking on the job directly and potentially spoiling a friendship :) 

I tend to forget how hard-won my 10 years of accumulated web knowledge has been and how valuable it could be to new designers &amp;amp; developers.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        This is such a great idea, don’t know of many others who’ve done something like this but it sounds like it’d be really helpful to someone trying to get experience.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
