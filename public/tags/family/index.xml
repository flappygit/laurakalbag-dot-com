      <title>My 2015</title>

      <description>I’m not even sure how to write about 2015… 2015 can die in a fire, go away and never come back.
My mother died in August, three months after her mother, my grandmother, died in April. Missing them both has really done me over. Grieving is not what I expected, it just makes everything exhausting. Oddly, knitting helped.
In July, we moved from Brighton to Reigate to stay with my family.</description>

      <description>At the beginning of the week, I had fun talking to Victor Johnson on Episode 9 of the Subjective podcast, ‘Free As In Liberty.’ I ranted a lot, and we talked about Ind.ie, diversity, my upbringing, and how I got into design and the web.
Subjective is also a great podcast in its infancy, with Victor at the helm, it’s definitely one to watch (or listen!)</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I was asked to create a playlist of ten songs for Desert.fm. Nate, Bobby and Jamie sent me an email with the premise:
 Our idea is to to add value to digital playlists through personal stories and inspirational music. We’re totally genre agnostic and we don’t judge (honest!), we can find inspiration in the most unlikely of places sometimes, so we encourage our curators not to hold back.</description>
