      <title>My 2015</title>

&lt;p&gt;I’m not even sure how to write about 2015… 2015 can die in a fire, go away and never come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother died in August, three months after her mother, my grandmother, died in April. Missing them both has really done me over. Grieving is not what I expected, it just makes everything exhausting. Oddly, knitting helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July, we moved from Brighton to Reigate to stay with my family. We intended to stay a couple of months while we &lt;a href=&#34;https://ar.al/notes/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/&#34;&gt;planned our move abroad to escape the Tories and their Investigatory Powers Bill&lt;/a&gt;. By chance, I got a month at home with my mother before she died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ind.ie/blog/happy-indie-new-year/&#34;&gt;At Ind.ie we were struggling for money&lt;/a&gt;, and I wanted to be close to my family, so it made sense to stick around in Surrey. It now just about feels right (and just about affordable) to move away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/my-2014/&#34;&gt;my fitness, reading, and writing goals from 2014&lt;/a&gt; seem trite. Ind.ie is still incredibly important to me, and I’m sure we’ll do more great things in 2016. &lt;a href=&#34;https://ind.ie/blog/happy-indie-new-year/&#34;&gt;Aral’s blog post&lt;/a&gt; sums up our Ind.ie year well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals-for-2016&#34;&gt;Goals for 2016&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be efficient. Busywork isn’t productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the most of everything.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Interview on the Subjective podcast</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the week, I had fun talking to Victor Johnson on &lt;a href=&#34;http://subjective.fm/episodes/9&#34;&gt;Episode 9 of the Subjective podcast, ‘Free As In Liberty.’&lt;/a&gt; I ranted &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt;, and we talked about Ind.ie, diversity, my upbringing, and how I got into design and the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://subjective.fm&#34;&gt;Subjective&lt;/a&gt; is also a great podcast in its infancy, with Victor at the helm, it’s definitely one to watch (or listen!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Desert.fm Playlist</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/desert-fm-playlist/</link>

      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/desert-fm-playlist/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I was asked to create a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.desert.fm/laura-kalbag.html&#34;&gt;playlist of ten songs for Desert.fm&lt;/a&gt;. Nate, Bobby and Jamie sent me an email with the premise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our idea is to to add value to digital playlists through personal stories and inspirational music. We’re totally genre agnostic and we don’t judge (honest!), we can find inspiration in the most unlikely of places sometimes, so we encourage our curators not to hold back. If theres a story to it we want to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music is, like it is to many people, a big part of my life. Listening to music together has always been a family activity, and with such a big family, we all developed very critical opinions of each others’ tastes. My dad taught us that it doesn’t matter if your taste in music isn’t “cool”, so I went very non-mainstream in my teens and haven’t looked back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My desert.fm playlist is semi-chronological and describes the context of the music in my life, as I went from enjoying what my dad shared with us, to developing my own &lt;em&gt;very particular&lt;/em&gt; taste. I’ve explained why I love the music, the band or just that song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also created a &lt;a href=&#34;http://open.spotify.com/user/laurakalbag/playlist/0cPri8LcgM6XgoNcILuDO2&#34;&gt;Spotify playlist of these tracks&lt;/a&gt; if you want to just get down to listening.&lt;/p&gt;
