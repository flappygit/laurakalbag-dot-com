      <description>A few weeks ago I answered some questions for Workspiration on my hardware and software setup, inspiration and dreams.
Workspiration seems to have collected interviews from a huge variety of people working in and around tech, and with everybody answering the same questions, it makes for a really interesting read. Bonus is that they also (eventually) translate the interviews into Russian. It’s nice to see a site that’s open to non-English speakers!</description>
