		<p>On my last day in Berlin, I took a lot more photos. Last night I started post-processing them, following Ashley’s email and video tutorials. Post-processing is an area where I have more experience, I’ve done a lot of Photoshopping in the past, but now I’m trying to achieve new effects using Lightroom, which is a very different animal!</p>

		**Me in a hotel room, original.** Travelling in Berlin, and being a bit slow to set up shots, I found my only (mostly) willing model was me. I found it really hard to get the focus on my face, so my hands are slightly crisper.

		<p>
		In post-processing, I cropped out the most distracting parts of the shot, and straightened the bottom line of the mirror slightly. I adjusted the white balance so the lighting feels more natural. Using Ashley’s eye pop tutorial, I tweaked my eyes, but because my irises are almost black, I looked a bit scary if I lightened them!

		**Reichpietschufer, original.** It was a bright but overcast day, so the original was high contrast but a bit dull.

	<figcaption>
		<p>
		**Reichpietschufer.** I wanted to soften it a little in post-processing, so it has a bit more of a retro feel. I also straightened it so the sign is along a properly horizontal line.
