<p>I don’t know if you know, but I made the website for the upcoming super exciting mobile conference, <a href="http://thebigm.mobi" title="The Big M website">The Big M</a>.</p>

<p>As a result, I have 3 conference tickets worth £233.83 to give away to lovely people who want to learn more about mobile (covering topics such as innovation, usability, development, apps and mobile web.)</p>

<p>My 3 tickets are for the first day, the conference part of The Big M, which is on <strong>21st March 2011</strong> at Komedia in <strong>Bath</strong> (UK.) I’d love some friendly people to come along and keep me company (that’s not an obligation!)</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-have-to-do-to-get-a-ticket">What do I have to do to get a ticket?</h2>

<p>So, all you have to do to win a ticket is tweet something with the hashtag **#sendmetothebigm **or just leave me a comment below <strong>before 12noon tomorrow</strong> (3rd March.) I’ll pick three people at random after that and let you know via this blog page and via Twitter.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-don-t-get-one">What if I don’t get one?</h2>

<p>There’s still some tickets left on <a href="http://thebigm.mobi/#register" title="Tickets for The Big M">The Big M website</a>. With tickets as little as £199 +vat for a conference day pass and student conferences passes at just £50 +vat, you’d be mad to miss out on a fun new event in beautiful Bath.</p>
