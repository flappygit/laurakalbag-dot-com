This was a podcast that Rachel had in the works for a while, and we first recorded together a few months ago.

		<p>Yesterday the <a href="http://www.beyondink.co.uk/shows/01-laura-and-simon">first episode</a> of <a href="http://www.beyondink.co.uk">the Beyond Ink podcast</a> went live.

<p>Rachel and I chatted about process, the type of work we like to do and inspiration, amongst other things. I think this will shape up to be a great podcast for insights into different designer’s working processes.</p>
