<meta property="og:description" content="Last November at Build conference 2012, I had fun talking to some of the folks from Typecast about building, web design, responsive design and type. They recorded these videos (along with a load of lovely, smart and cool people!) and made a nice collection that you can watch on their website.
Typecast are also giving away a ticket to Build conference 2013 and some Typecast subscriptions. The draw closes tomorrow, so you’d better be quick!" />
