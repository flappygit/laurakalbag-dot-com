<p>2012 has been a massive year for me. It was a year of saying yes to things that scared me. It was the first time I spoke at a conference (and <a href="/conferences/" title="Conferences">I went on to speak at a further seven events.</a>) I found the first house I’ve lived in by myself. I travelled to as many countries in one year as I had done in my whole life so far. It was the end of a long relationship and a completely unexpected falling head-over-heels into a new one. And I got this tiny little puppy who didn’t just become enormous, but became one of the biggest and best things in my life.</p>

<p>I started writing a long post detailing each month and realised I have too many highlights and I’d be here all night. However this year was the year I started taking lots of photos. So I thought I’d share the few that mean the most to me.</p>

<h2 id="goals-for-2013">Goals for 2013</h2>

<p>I didn’t make any goals this year, but seeing everyone commenting on theirs has inspired me to set some for 2013.</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep saying yes to things that scare me</li>
<li>Get a better balance of more client work and be more fussy about the conferences I attend (19 events in one year is too many!)</li>
<li>Be more efficient with my time</li>
</ol>

<p>They’re the loose and achievable kind of goals I can get behind…</p>

<p>Happy New Year everyone!</p>
