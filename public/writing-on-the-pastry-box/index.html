<p>Today is the day <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/laura-kalbag/2014-january-11">my first “thought” of the year is published on The Pastry Box</a>. When Alex asked me if I wanted to be a part of The Pastry Box project, I leapt at the chance. There are some fantastic people who have contributed such interesting thoughts and ideas over there in the last couple of years, and looking at <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/bakers/year/2014">the lineup for this year</a>, I’m sure that won’t be changing anytime soon. It’s very exciting to join in, and I really love the <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/philosophy">philosophy of consuming content in a way that works for you, and ensures the content’s longevity</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ethics">Ethics</h2>

<p>I had a great conversation about ethics in client work with Andy Clarke on the <a href="http://unfinished.bz/50">Unfinished Business podcast</a> a few weeks ago. In a world where society is clearly struggling with so many issues (wealth/poverty divide, human rights, privacy, and so on) I wonder how I can make a difference, or prevent myself from being complicit in further problems.</p>

<p>In the run-up to my publishing date on The Pastry Box (it’ll likely be the 11th of each month) I was so worried about what I would write, and trying to come up with something interesting. Then I read <a href="http://mostlysignssomeportents.tumblr.com/post/72759474218/we-are-huxleying-ourselves-into-the-full-orwell">this post by Cory Doctorow</a>, and had some worrying conversations about other people’s attitude to privacy with <a href="http://aralbalkan.com">Aral</a>. Suddenly I found myself writing an incoherent stream of anger into my notebook. A long thoughtful walk with the dog later, and I finally had something that might be worth sharing.</p>

<p>Please let me know what you think, this means a lot to me.</p>
