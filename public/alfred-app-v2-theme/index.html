		<p>Today I finally got around to playing with <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred v2</a>. This is the one OSX app I’ll allow to open on login, I use it to launch every app and find every file. I use it to work out maths for my CSS and double-check the meanings of words I’m about to write. And it does so much more.</p>

<p>I was playing around with the appearance and made a really minimal theme. There was a handy sharing feature so I thought I may as well share it…</p>
