<p>A couple of days ago, a potential project turned up in my inbox. An old school friend wants a website, needs it soon and doesn’t have a huge budget.</p>

<h2 id="me-and-freelancing">Me and freelancing</h2>

<p>I’m lucky, I get offered a lot of projects, and usually I don’t have any availability for a few months. Little projects like this generally can’t pay the bills for me. It’s a lot of time (particularly admin) for a fairly small return.</p>

<p>I have a very small list of trusted designers that I’ll happily pass these projects. The thing is, when I do this, it’s a risk for me too. If I recommend someone who turns out to be unreliable, it makes me look bad too.</p>

<h2 id="the-inspiration">The inspiration</h2>

<p>After listening to <a href="http://unfinished.bz/">Unfinished Business</a> with <a href="http://unfinished.bz/#presenters">Anna Debenham and Andy Clarke</a>, I’ve been inspired to be more open about how I work. I’ve never been one to keep secrets, I’m always happy to discuss my rates and how I work with anyone, but I’ve never actively shared this information. And after talking to loads of students recently, I’ve realised that one of the hardest things, after landing a project in the first place, is knowing how to run a project and talk to clients.</p>

<h2 id="the-idea">The idea</h2>

<p>These thoughts and this project collided in my mind.</p>

<p>I want to help “de-mystify” these elements of freelancing. I wouldn’t call myself an expert, I’m not sure many people could. But after around four years of freelancing, I feel like I am <em>successful</em>; I make enough money to support myself, living and working by myself.</p>

<p>It strikes me that the transition from student to freelancer is particularly hard, and so I’m looking for students/graduates/new freelancers to work on this project. Here’s the tweet that I sent out:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/laurakalbag/status/296305016954834944">Tweet</a>
I’ve already had more than twenty replies, my next goal is to make sure I find one or two people who can gain as much as possible from this project. If you’re interested, please <a href="/contact-me/" title="Contact Me">email me</a>. I’ll hopefully be sending out an email to everyone who’s interested later on today.</p>

<p>I’m hoping to blog the process as much as possible, so other people can share in our experience. My next post will cover how I’m going to try to find a good match to work on the project.</p>

        <p>Laura :)

just wanted to repeat that I think this is such a brilliant idea, one which all parties will benefit from for sure :)

Working with real clients is something that teaches so much, having a mentor / expert at hand to run to for help and advise is invaluable. As a student or newcomer to the field, it is often scary—though it does not need to be.

This is one of the reasons why I get my students to work with a [ real client project ](http://webeyedea.info/wp/real-client-sites/" rel="nofollow) during my course. Tends to be quite time-consuming for me, to manage it all (number of students = number of clients)—but… **it is really worth it**: happy, grateful clients &amp; happy, more informed newbies &amp; one happy tutor :-)</p>
Your idea of doing this is fabulous –; hope you will find a good match :) and really hope this will inspire more web peeps to follow suit :)

        This is a great idea Laura. I’ve had a couple of <i>“those”</i> kind of job requests recently and this seems a much more constructive approach than taking on the job directly and potentially spoiling a friendship :) 

I tend to forget how hard-won my 10 years of accumulated web knowledge has been and how valuable it could be to new designers &amp; developers.

        This is such a great idea, don’t know of many others who’ve done something like this but it sounds like it’d be really helpful to someone trying to get experience.
