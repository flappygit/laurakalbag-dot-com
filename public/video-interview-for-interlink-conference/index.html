<p>Last week I had <a href="http://interlinkconference.com/2014/03/laura-kalbag-design-gretzky-maple-syrup/">a chat with my friend Steve Fisher about my upcoming talk and workshop at Interlink conference and all things Canadian</a>. It was a fun way to end the day, and is complete with me doing a really terrible Canadian accent. It made me <em>even more</em> excited for <a href="http://interlinkconference.com">Interlink in June</a>, I can’t wait!</p>

<p>If you want to know a bit more about my workshop, I’ve put <a href="/design-theory-for-the-web-workshop-at-interlink-conference/" title="Design theory for the web workshop at Interlink conference">some extra details in a blog post about the workshop</a>, and you should check out the amazing <a href="http://interlinkconference.com/conference/">conference lineup</a>. It looks like there’s still some <a href="http://interlinkconference.com/register/">Super Early Bird tickets</a> left, so you should grab them before they’re gone!</p>
