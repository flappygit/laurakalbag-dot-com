<p>I’m not even sure how to write about 2015… 2015 can die in a fire, go away and never come back.</p>

<p>My mother died in August, three months after her mother, my grandmother, died in April. Missing them both has really done me over. Grieving is not what I expected, it just makes everything exhausting. Oddly, knitting helped.</p>

<p>In July, we moved from Brighton to Reigate to stay with my family. We intended to stay a couple of months while we <a href="https://ar.al/notes/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/">planned our move abroad to escape the Tories and their Investigatory Powers Bill</a>. By chance, I got a month at home with my mother before she died.</p>

<p><a href="https://ind.ie/blog/happy-indie-new-year/">At Ind.ie we were struggling for money</a>, and I wanted to be close to my family, so it made sense to stick around in Surrey. It now just about feels right (and just about affordable) to move away.</p>

<p>Looking back, <a href="/my-2014/">my fitness, reading, and writing goals from 2014</a> seem trite. Ind.ie is still incredibly important to me, and I’m sure we’ll do more great things in 2016. <a href="https://ind.ie/blog/happy-indie-new-year/">Aral’s blog post</a> sums up our Ind.ie year well.</p>

<h2 id="goals-for-2016">Goals for 2016</h2>

<ol>
<li>Be efficient. Busywork isn’t productivity.</li>
<li>Make the most of everything.

<br /></li>
