We discussed how I got started in the industry (really sorry traditional Graphic Design people, I may have generalised a bit…), speaking at conferences, women in the industry and mentoring.
As I said last night on Twitter, Tim Smith is such a great guy." />

		<p>Yesterday I was a guest on <a href="http://twitter.com/ttimsmith">Tim Smith</a>‘s <a href="http://theeastwing.net/">The East Wing podcast</a>. It was a pre-recorded conversation and it was great fun. You can <a href="http://theeastwing.net/episodes/laura-kalbag">listen to it on the East Wing website</a>, and it’ll be up on iTunes soon.</p>

<p>We discussed how I got started in the industry (really sorry traditional Graphic Design people, I may have generalised a bit…), speaking at conferences, women in the industry and mentoring.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/laurakalbag/status/298862630506991616">I said last night on Twitter</a>, Tim Smith is such a great guy. I really had my heart warmed and faith in humanity boosted by our conversation. His thoughts on women in the industry made me proud to be part of the web community.</p>

<p>And if you don’t already <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-east-wing/id503801143?mt=2">subscribe to The East Wing podcast</a>, do it! It’s full of great, and inspiring, insight on the people behind the work in the web industry.</p>
