		<p>In October, I found myself doing a lot more in Terminal than I’d done before, and I needed a computer with a faster processor, so I upgraded to a MacBook Pro. This means that my pimped-out Mid 2013 MacBook Air that I bought in December 2013 is now for sale. It’s in nearly-new condition, as it’s been kept in a shell case for almost all its (short) life. I used it for around 8 months. These are the specs:</p>

<ul>
<li>13.3&rdquo; Mid 2013 MacBook Air</li>
<li>Processor 1.7GHz Intel Dual-Core Core i7</li>
<li>Memory 8GB 1600MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM</li>
<li>Hard Drive 512GB Flash Storage</li>
<li>Fresh install of OS X Mavericks (easily upgraded to Yosemite)</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP678?viewlocale=en_US&amp;amp;locale=en_US">exactly the same specs</a> as a <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/compare/notebooks.html">fully-specced new MacBook Air</a>, so you’ll be getting yourself a bargain. I paid £1,579 for it, and you can get it from Apple for £1,499. I’m looking for £1,100, and I’ll include free UPS delivery inside the UK.</p>
