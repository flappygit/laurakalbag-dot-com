The inaugural Breaking Borders event will have the lovely Steve Workman speaking about Front-end web architectures that won’t bite you (in the ass) and me speaking about design systems.
If you’re in the area, I really recommend you join us. If Ben’s events are anything like his front-end development skills, it’s going to be great!" />
