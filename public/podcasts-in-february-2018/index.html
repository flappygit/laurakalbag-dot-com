CodeNewbie CodeNewbie Season 3 Episode 4: What should developers know about online privacy? with Laura Kalbag
CodeNewbie is a fantastic podcast by Saron Yitbarek featuring interviews that introduce topics to people who are new to coding. You can find the podcast on the CodeNewbie site along with a full transcript. One note is that I am continually muddling up the GDPR acronym, calling the GDPR the “General Directive Privacy Regulation” when it is actually “General Data Protection Regulation." />

<p><a href="https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/what-should-developers-know-about-online-privacy">CodeNewbie Season 3 Episode 4: What should developers know about online privacy? with Laura Kalbag</a></p>

<p>CodeNewbie is a fantastic podcast by Saron Yitbarek featuring interviews that introduce topics to people who are new to coding. You can <a href="https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/what-should-developers-know-about-online-privacy">find the podcast on the CodeNewbie site</a> along with a full transcript. One note is that I am continually muddling up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> acronym, calling the GDPR the “General Directive Privacy Regulation” when it is actually “General Data Protection Regulation.” Ugh, acronyms…</p>

<h2 id="digital-mindfulness">Digital Mindfulness</h2>

<p><a href="https://digitalmindfulness.net/96-ethical-data-design-laura-kalbag/">Digital Mindfulness #96 Ethical Data &amp; Design with Laura Kalbag</a></p>

<p>Digital Mindfulness is a podcast by Lawrence Ampofo looking at “digital experiences that focus on time well spent.” As I mentioned to Lawrence, I do not agree with a lot of the work in this area, so it made for an interesting interview which disagrees with many of the podcast’s previous guests. You can <a href="https://digitalmindfulness.net/96-ethical-data-design-laura-kalbag/">find the podcast on the Digital Mindfulness site</a>.</p>
