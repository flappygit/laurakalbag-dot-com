<p>Yesterday I gave a talk at the <a href="http://environmentsforhumans.com/2013/css-summit/">fantastic online conference CSS Summit</a> on ‘Sass for designers’. It uses <a href="http://webtalkdogwalk.in/brighton/">my new site Web Talk Dog Walk</a> as a case study, and explains the basics of Sass and how to get started using <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a>.</p>

<p>Usually I wouldn’t recommend checking out my slides, as they’re useless without me explaining them, but as this was an online conference and I wanted the slides to be extra clear in case of technical problems, they hopefully read in a fairly easy-to-follow way:</p>

<p><a href="/conferences/#post-3873">See the Sass for designers slides on my Conferences page</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve also made <a href="https://github.com/laurakalbag/webtalkdogwalk">most of the site code (the stuff not covered by other people’s licenses!) available on GitHub</a>. I’ve tried to make the commits fit in with the slides as much as possible.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Edits: the very kind <a href="https://twitter.com/roy/status/360670152855011328">Roy Tomeij</a> wrote a post about <a href="http://roytomeij.com/2013/should-you-use-a-sass-mixin-or-extend.html">when to use mixins vs @extend in Sass</a> following my talk. I didn’t know much about @extend, but now I do! So <a href="http://roytomeij.com/2013/should-you-use-a-sass-mixin-or-extend.html">this is some additional recommended reading</a>.</p>

<p>Andy Spicer also asked if I could share my <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a> mockups for the site design. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/13tfiy8xzworplz/Web%20talk%20dog%20walk%20mockup.zip">You can download the zipped .sketch file here</a>. I use <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/beta/">the latest version of the Sketch beta</a>, so you’ll need to use this to open the file as it may not be compatible with older versions.</p>

        A good wee article Laura. Always interested in seeing other workflows. The more I read about Sass, the more powerful it gets. 

Until recently I didn’t know about placeholder selectors. Also, with RWD projects I’ve moved my breakpoint calls into a mixin and passing the breakpoint by a variable.

So many great tools out there at the moment :-)
