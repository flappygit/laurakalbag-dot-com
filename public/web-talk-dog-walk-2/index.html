<p>The last web talk dog walk was a success, with three of us (plus three dogs) taking in the slightly damp wilds of Sheepcote Valley. Now for the next one!</p>

<p>Meeting at the same spot on the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=203285113495597462862.0004deb99f76f41c37bbd&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;ll=50.816724,-0.102396&amp;amp;spn=0.00281,0.006968">corner of Wilson Avenue and Roedean Road</a> planning to walk for an hour or so (maybe slightly longer if I continue navigating badly) in <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=203285113495597462862.0004deb99f76f41c37bbd&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;ll=50.816724,-0.102396&amp;amp;spn=0.00281,0.006968">East Brighton Park/Sheepcote valley</a>. I drew some routes on the map below, but I’m a terrible navigator so I can’t promise we’ll stick to them. Some lovely people have been clearing the paths in Sheepcote Valley so it shouldn’t be too much of a jungle exploration!</p>

<h2 id="anyone-can-join-us">Anyone can join us</h2>

<ul>
<li>No need to bring a dog if you just want to walk and talk</li>
<li>But please bring a dog or few if you’ve got them, walking with a pack makes it more fun!</li>
<li>You don’t have to be a freelancer or professional or even work with the web, just happy to chat</li>
<li>You don’t have to come every time, just whenever you fancy it</li>
<li>We’ll leave pretty soon after 9am so please be on time or be willing to catch us up!</li>
<li>You don’t need to let me know beforehand if you’re coming along, but I’ll know to wait for you if you send me a <a href="http://twitter.com/laurakalbag">tweet @laurakalbag</a> beforehand</li>
<li>Wear sensible walking shoes. Trainers should do. It’s a fairly mud-free route, but it can be rough terrain and a bit hilly</li>
<li>Do I need to recommend you wear a jacket if the weather’s grey? Does it ever rain in Britain?</li>
</ul>
