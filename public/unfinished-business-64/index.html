		<p>On Friday I was a guest on the <a href="http://unfinished.bz/64">Unfinished Business podcast</a> again. It was a special episode as <a href="http://rachelandrew.co.uk">Rachel Andrew</a> was also a guest (yeah, I designed her site!) I don’t like to go on about stuff like this too often, but if you’d told 21 year old me (7 years ago) that I’d be appearing on a podcast with Andy Clarke and Rachel Andrew, it would’ve blown my mind. They’re two very lovely people whose writing helped me learn about, and become so excited about, the web.</p>

<p>The show is focused around the closure of Five Simple Steps, the great publishers of web-themed books, last week. I’ve never written a book, and have only recently started writing much, so I learned a lot from Andy and Rachel as seasoned writers (and ex-Five Simple Steps authors).</p>
