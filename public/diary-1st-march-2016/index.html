It’s been a busy and exhausting week. Oskar and I made our 800 mile trip in one day, thanks to the wonderful “courier” and took another day to recover. Then it was straight into the office.
The last week has been meeting new friends, relocation admin, and arranging a few events for the year. All the while Aral has been coding." />

<p>Well… we’re here! In Malmö, sitting in our new office at Media Evolution City.</p>

<p>It’s been a busy and exhausting week. Oskar and I made our 800 mile trip in one day, thanks to the wonderful “courier” and took another day to recover. Then it was straight into the office.</p>

<p>The last week has been meeting new friends, relocation admin, and arranging a few events for the year. All the while Aral has been coding. (And he intends to write a moving-related update on our blog ASAP!) Things will move much faster now we’re in a city with a supportive community and a proper place to work…</p>
