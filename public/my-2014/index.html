<p>Well, things didn’t slow down in 2014! So much so that I didn’t manage to write this post yesterday. In 2014 I spoke at 8 events in 4 countries, and worked with 11 clients on 15 projects before starting work full time with <a href="https://ind.ie">Ind.ie</a> in August.</p>

<p>I wrote a lot more, with regular slots on<a href="http://alistapart.com/author/laurakalbag"> A List Apart</a> and <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/baker/laura-kalbag">The Pastry Box</a>, and a series on <a href="http://webstandardssherpa.com/about/authors/laura-kalbag/">Getting Started With Sass on Web Standards Sherpa</a>. And I had more fun on podcasts including co-hosting <a href="http://unfinished.bz">Unfinished Business</a> with Ashley Baxter in August.</p>

<p>Again, I’ve summarised my year in photos:</p>

</a>## Following goals for 2014</p>

<h3 id="1-collaborate-more">1. Collaborate more.</h3>

<p>Joining Ind.ie meant I went from working remotely, to suddenly working with a team of people in our house every day. It definitely resulted in a lot more collaboration!</p>

<h3 id="2-be-more-selective-say-no-more-often">2. Be more selective, say no more often.</h3>

<p>Early on in the year, I decided to only speak at an event every other month. I mostly succeeded in this, and it meant I was less stressed, and also enjoyed the events I spoke at a lot more.</p>

<h3 id="3-challenge-myself-physically-in-a-new-way">3. Challenge myself physically in a new way.</h3>

<p>I sort-of managed this one. I tried ballet, but it’s not for me anymore. I tried Crossfit, but the nearest location is slightly too far away to attend frequently. Doing much more challenging courses of Pilates has had a positive impact on my year.</p>

<h2 id="goals-for-2015">Goals for 2015</h2>

<p>I have a big writing project to finish, which needs hard work and lot of confidence, but I also want to share more design and development writing on my blog and the <a href="https://ind.ie/about/blog">Ind.ie blog</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Write more.</li>
<li>Read more.</li>
<li>Make the most of Ind.ie.</li>
</ol>

<p>My life has changed a lot in the last year as I’ve started working with Ind.ie. It’s really important to me that we make a difference, and create alternatives to spyware technologies. I’ve got an amazing opportunity to work with the rest of the team to do something about the current system. I need to make sure I make the most of it, work hard, don’t let my insecurities get the better of me, and stand up for what I believe in.</p>

        @Damian thanks :)

I find there’s benefits in both working freelance and in a team. There’s less disruption during the working day if you’re working alone. But when you work in a team you can make more progress coming up with ideas, learning from each other, and bouncing thoughts and problems around.
