<h2 id="oh-and-one-more-thing-slide-stage">Oh, and one more thing: Slide + Stage</h2>

<p>One of the sponsors this week was <a href="http://thelink.is/unfinishedbusiness">Slide + Stage</a>, a full-day intensive masterclass with <a href="http://aralbalkan.com">Aral Balkan</a>. It’s going to be brilliant and I’m going to be there. I’ve already <a href="/learning-to-speak/" title="Learning to speak">written a post about how much I’ve learnt from Aral</a>, and if you want to speak at events, or even just become better at presenting your work to clients, I really recommend you come along.</p>
