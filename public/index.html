	Please excuse the wonkiness of my site. I am iterating on a new design, including all new backend. It’s static!
Because I apparently like to be stressed, I had a hard time limit for deploying this new design (today!) This means some of the content is a little garbled, and a lot of the CSS, particularly the colour schemes, needs refining in places.
For now I won’t be publicising this new design, so if you’re here and you’re seeing this, shhh! <a href="/site-update-2017/">Read Wonky for now</a>.

	After three years of work, I can finally tell you that I’ve written a book for A Book Apart about web accessibility called Accessibility For Everyone.
 
In case you’ve not heard of web accessibility (you wouldn’t be the first!), web accessibility is the degree to which a website is usable by as many people as possible. A lot of material around accessibility focus on making websites usable by people with different types of disabilities and impairments, but designing inclusively for a wide range of needs will generally make websites more usable for everyone. <a href="/accessibility-for-everyone/">Read Accessibility For Everyone</a>.

	This is the talk I gave at DIBI Conference in Edinburgh in March 2017. Many people asked me for my slides, but I wanted to include them in context, with accessible links. This is roughly how it went:
 
Performance! Nowadays performance seems to be the hot topic of the web industry. So let’s have a look at how we might improve the speed of a web page. <a href="/you-wont-believe-what-happens-next/">Read Digital Assistants, Facebook Quizzes, And Fake News! You Won’t Believe What Happens Next</a>.
