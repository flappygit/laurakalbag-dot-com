We make <a href="https://better.fyi">Better for iPhone and iPad</a> to protect you from tracking while you’re browsing the web. You should give it a go! My book <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone">Accessibility For Everyone</a> is available in paperback and ebook from A Book Apart.</p>

	Semantic HTML on 24 Ways

	It’s been a few years since I wrote something for 24ways, but this year I’m back, making the case for semantic HTML.
 
As I mention in the article, I see a lot of redundant and unsemantic HTML while I’m working on Better. HTML is often seen as easy, and therefore not worth learning in detail. It’s frustrating because HTML is one of the few completely unavoidable technologies of the web. <a href="/semantic-html-on-24-ways/">Read Semantic HTML on 24 Ways</a>.

	Please excuse the wonkiness of my site. I am iterating on a new design, including all new backend. It’s static!
Because I apparently like to be stressed, I had a hard time limit for deploying this new design (today!) This means some of the content is a little garbled, and a lot of the CSS, particularly the colour schemes, needs refining in places.
For now I won’t be publicising this new design, so if you’re here and you’re seeing this, shhh! <a href="/site-update-2017/">Read Wonky for now</a>.

	After three years of work, I can finally tell you that I’ve written a book for A Book Apart about web accessibility called Accessibility For Everyone.
 
In case you’ve not heard of web accessibility (you wouldn’t be the first!), web accessibility is the degree to which a website is usable by as many people as possible. A lot of material around accessibility focus on making websites usable by people with different types of disabilities and impairments, but designing inclusively for a wide range of needs will generally make websites more usable for everyone. <a href="/accessibility-for-everyone/">Read Accessibility For Everyone</a>.
