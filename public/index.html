We make <a href="https://better.fyi">Better for iPhone and iPad</a> to protect you from tracking while you’re browsing the web.

	Probably the coolest I’ve ever sounded…
Last week Ind.ie was featured in a Guardian article, ‘The punk rock internet – how DIY ​​rebels ​are working to ​replace the tech giants.’ We were interviewed by John Harris, and I think he did a really great job of explaining what we do and why we do it.
Not having massive experience in being interviewed, I was a little nervous that I’d sound a bit daft, especially as I’m nowhere near as eloquent as Aral. <a href="/im-a-diy-rebel/">Read I’m a DIY Rebel</a>.

	Semantic HTML on 24 Ways

</h3>
<p class="entry-meta">Posted: 22 December 2017</p>
<div class="summary">
	<p>
	It’s been a few years since I wrote something for 24ways, but this year I’m back, making the case for semantic HTML.
 
As I mention in the article, I see a lot of redundant and unsemantic HTML while I’m working on Better. HTML is often seen as easy, and therefore not worth learning in detail. It’s frustrating because HTML is one of the few completely unavoidable technologies of the web. <a href="/semantic-html-on-24-ways/">Read Semantic HTML on 24 Ways</a>.

<p class="entry-meta">Posted: 30 November 2017</p>
<div class="summary">
	<p>
	Please excuse the wonkiness of my site. I am iterating on a new design, including all new backend. It’s static!
Because I apparently like to be stressed, I had a hard time limit for deploying this new design (today!) This means some of the content is a little garbled, and a lot of the CSS, particularly the colour schemes, needs refining in places.
For now I won’t be publicising this new design, so if you’re here and you’re seeing this, shhh! <a href="/site-update-2017/">Read Wonky for now</a>.
