		A few weeks ago I gave a workshop in New Zealand about designing inclusive content and accessible design. Afterwards, I was asked for recommended reading on accessible animation. These are a bunch of bookmarks I’ve stored up, and what I’d recommend to get started on designing and building animations in an inclusive way:
Books  Designing Interface Animation by Val Head. Animation At Work by Rachel Nabors.  Articles  Your Interactive Makes Me Sick by Eileen Webb. <a href="/bookmarked-on-animation/">Read Bookmarked: Animation</a>.

		In February, there were two podcasts released featuring interviews with me! Both focused on ethical design and privacy.
CodeNewbie CodeNewbie Season 3 Episode 4: What should developers know about online privacy? with Laura Kalbag
CodeNewbie is a fantastic podcast by Saron Yitbarek featuring interviews that introduce topics to people who are new to coding. You can find the podcast on the CodeNewbie site along with a full transcript. One note is that I am continually muddling up the GDPR acronym, calling the GDPR the “General Directive Privacy Regulation” when it is actually “General Data Protection Regulation. <a href="/podcasts-in-february-2018/">Read Podcasts, February 2018</a>.

		Probably the coolest I’ve ever sounded…
Last week Ind.ie was featured in a Guardian article, ‘The punk rock internet – how DIY ​​rebels ​are working to ​replace the tech giants.’ We were interviewed by John Harris, and I think he did a really great job of explaining what we do and why we do it.
Not having massive experience in being interviewed, I was a little nervous that I’d sound a bit daft, especially as I’m nowhere near as eloquent as Aral. <a href="/im-a-diy-rebel/">Read I’m a DIY Rebel</a>.
