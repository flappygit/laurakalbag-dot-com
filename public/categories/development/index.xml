      <description>&lt;p&gt;I added a flexbox layout to our Universal Video Player (accessible HTML5 video player) and wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://ind.ie/labs/blog/video-player-flexbox/&#34;&gt;a blog post on Ind.ie Labs about using flexbox with progressive enhancement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A little realign</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/a-little-realign/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Things are looking a bit different around here. It’s not a redesign so much as a &lt;a href=&#34;http://alistapart.com/article/redesignrealign&#34;&gt;realign&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been tinkering for a few months, and finally got to the point where I’m happy to push it live (even though there’s more I could do.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few particular goals for this redesign:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rewrite-the-css&#34;&gt;Rewrite the CSS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lived in fear that someone might look closely at my CSS. My last redesign came about when responsive web design was still young, and I was incredibly foolish. I linked to three different stylesheets in my header, one for 320px and up, one for 768px and up, and one for 1024px and up. There were some “minor” breakpoints in these stylesheets, but yes, I was using fairly device-based breakpoints, and that was three HTTP requests in the head. Certainly not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous version was also a peculiar Sass/plain CSS hybrid as I’d started learning Sass a few months into the redesign. As Sass is so easy to integrate into ordinary CSS, it wasn’t too problematic, but I knew I could lessen repetition and make the structure of my CSS much easier to maintain if I moved it all into a consistent format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’ve rewritten all the CSS from scratch using Sass, and added in a few new techniques, such as flexbox, for some of the form elements. If you’re interested in how badly I write Sass, I’ve uploaded those files (in the spirit of Dan Eden’s max CSS) into a /sass folder and you can find the file references in the main file, &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/wp-content/themes/laurakalbag-2014/sass/style.scss&#34;&gt;style.scss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reboot-the-typography&#34;&gt;Reboot the typography&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Avenir, I really do, but I was increasingly aware that it can be hard work to read as body text. After falling in love with &lt;a href=&#34;http://hvdfonts.com/#189-Brandon%20Text&#34; title=&#34;Brandon Text typeface&#34;&gt;Brandon Text&lt;/a&gt;, I decided it was a nice evolution from Avenir, keeping the geometric shapes but in a softer, more legible, way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2014/05/previous-typography.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4455&#34;&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently read Tim Brown’s fantastic &lt;a href=&#34;http://nicewebtype.com/notes/2013/04/23/pocket-guide-to-combining-typefaces/&#34;&gt;Combining Typefaces&lt;/a&gt; book and felt encouraged to be braver with my typefaces choices. I didn’t want to just keep using different weights of the same family as I had before. After some &lt;a href=&#34;https://dribbble.com/shots/1510342-Freight-Micro-and-Brandon-Text-dilemma?list=users&amp;amp;amp;offset=6&#34; title=&#34;Dribbble shots showing the process of my heading typeface choice&#34;&gt;deliberation&lt;/a&gt; and advice, I settled on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rosettatype.com/Arek&#34;&gt;Arek&lt;/a&gt; for headings, to add a bit of quirky personality to my site. This is the first time I’ve used &lt;a href=&#34;http://fontdeck.com&#34;&gt;Fontdeck&lt;/a&gt; properly, and I’m really pleased with the quality of the font and the speedy rendering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2014/05/new-typography.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4456&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2014/05/new-typography.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Arek for the display text, and Brandon Text for the body text&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Arek for the display, and Brandon Text for the body on the new realign
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m both self-hosting and using external JavaScript to pull in fonts for my site. Brandon Text is self-hosted whereas Arek is hosted on Fontdeck. I can’t quite make up my mind whether I prefer to suffer slow loading times on my self-hosted fonts, or the risk of my site depending on another site for the fonts to load with a font delivery service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;simplify&#34;&gt;Simplify&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illustrations had to go. I’m always trying to tame my temptation to over-decorate, and while the illustrations in the previous version were a nice responsive bonus for large screens, a cleaner design is less distracting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2014/05/previous-homepage.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-large wp-image-4460&#34;&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, my homepage was my most hated page. And the most visited. It just felt like everything had been thrown on, it was unstructured and untidy. Given that the second most popular area of my site is the Past Projects, I decided to include twelve (nicely divisible for smaller screen sizes) images from my past projects and a brief introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2014/05/new-homepage.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-large wp-image-4458&#34;&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WordPress, by default, gives you so many options for meta information on archive pages. I previously listed the amount of comments, categories and tags on each post on the blog archive. On the projects archive I listed the dates and type of project. I realised these were unnecessary chunks of information that were easy enough to find on the single post or project pages. Just because I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; add everything to each template, it didn’t mean I should. Less repetitive content means the pages are now cleaner, easier to read, and nowhere near as long as before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-projects-with-dribbble-shots&#34;&gt;New projects with Dribbble shots&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been terrible at keeping my portfolio up to date in the last year. I’ve still got five projects that are halfway to being documented, but I’ve added four recent projects with some more in-depth explanations of the process. I want to keep adding more useful explanations to each project, making it more of a case study, so they’ll inevitably take a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-13.07.28.png&#34;&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hearing &lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz/37&#34;&gt;Andy Clarke chat with Dan Cederholm on Unfinished Business&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago, I shamelessly borrowed Andy’s great idea to include Dribbble shots from a project in my portfolio. I found a handy plugin to grab my Dribbble shots as they’re posted and add them into WordPress, so I can now easily connect my Dribbble shots to the relevant post and include a little gallery at the end of each project case study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-12.58.24.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;there-s-probably-more-to-do&#34;&gt;There’s probably more to do…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ever, there’s always more testing to be done. I don’t expect this site to be perfect, but I thought it was about time I hurried up and pushed it live. If you spot anything wonky, please let me know in the comments, &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/laurakalbag&#34;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/contact-me/&#34; title=&#34;Contact Me&#34;&gt;send me an email&lt;/a&gt;.

        Great decisions, Laura! I agree with you wholeheartedly on the font selections and home page redesign. I need to reanalyze my own site soon now that I have enough data to make those decisions. That’s the beauty of launching a product (your site) and then adjusting it as you go along based on the results you find.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hey Laura!

I have frequently visited your site in the past year for reference and inspiration. Even before the new “realign” I appreciated your bold choice of color and great copy (especially the “about” page).

I just so happened to be making a few adjustments to my own site late last night and turned to your site again for inspiration when I noticed the changes on your homepage, and I must say — brilliant little improvements. The fonts look great, and the new layout on the homepage is indeed simpler and quite inviting I think.

It reminds me also that as designers, and as people that grown and change, our websites don’t have to be something that we re-design every year-or-so — they can be continuously changed and adapted as we grow and learn, and our design tastes change as well.

It makes me think of [Frank Lloyd Wright’s Home and Studio](https://www.google.cl/search?q=inside+frank+lloyd+wright%27s+home+and+studio&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;hs=PHG&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;channel=sb&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=SK1jU5SPDPO0sASJkoHoBw&amp;amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;amp;biw=1360&amp;amp;bih=631&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow) in Hyde Park, Illinois (US). When you walk through it much of it seems like a hodgepodge of different styles and periods, and it was because it was his home, and he was constantly experimenting on it with new ideas that he would then take out into the wild and use on his paid projects. Shouldn’t our own websites be that too? Besides a portfolio or résumé or whatever, what better place for experimentation and growth? If you got feedback today that was overwhelming negative about the changes you made (doubt you will), well you’d just change them again. No big deal, right? What a great way to learn?!

Anyway, cheers to the realign, and keep killing it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the &lt;a href=&#34;http://backendy.com/2014/03/4-laura-kalbag/&#34;&gt;fourth episode of the Backendy podcast&lt;/a&gt; was released, and I was the guest. It was lovely talking to Darren, partly because he’s been a great client for a while now, partly because I’ve been working on the podcast logo and site, and also because I think a podcast focusing on back-end development is a really good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Browser windows and responsive language</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/browser-windows/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2013 18:59:17 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In the same way that we continually evolve the processes we use when working with clients, I’ve now found myself evolving and refining the language I use with clients when discussing responsive web design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;devices&#34;&gt;“Devices”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started out with talking about devices. “This design will use X on a mobile phone, Y on a tablet and Z on a desktop computer.” Then it seemed that, as a web community, we realised that the lines between these devices were fairly blurry. There’s no way of telling which device is being used without testing for user agents, and then &lt;a href=&#34;http://farukat.es/journal/2011/02/499-lest-we-forget-or-how-i-learned-whats-so-bad-about-browser-sniffing&#34;&gt;it’s likely that the user agent string is lying to us anyway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;screen-sizes&#34;&gt;“Screen sizes”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, many of us started talking about device-agnostic “screen sizes”. Being device-agnostic meant we’d hopefully stop trying to make assumptions about user behaviour based on the particular type of device they were using. Mobile phone users could be “mobile” but it wouldn’t make a difference to use because we were basing our designs on screen sizes and using the knowledge that some people could possibly be “mobile” to improve usability and performance for all our users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then we still keep hanging on to those devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that smart phones tend to start at around 320px, tablets possibly around 760px and then we often count anything upward of 900px as if it’s a desktop computer. If we talk about screen sizes like this, they still correspond to the screens on particular types of devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;browser-windows&#34;&gt;“Browser windows”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays I talk about “browser windows”. Yeah, these are often non-resizable fullscreen apps on the screens of various portable devices, but on desktop operating systems, a browser window could be &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I check out my own site’s analytics, there are visitors from 24 different browser window widths upward of 800px. And my responsive media queries are responding to those browser window sizes. Not the device, not the size of the screen, but the width of the browser window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s only counting browser sizes at 800px and above. Who’s to say that a user doesn’t resize their browser window so that it’s narrower than 800px? They might be using two windows side-by-side. This would mean that they’re viewing a narrow version of a site, responding to media queries we may have designed with mobile phones in mind…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;trying-to-be-clear&#34;&gt;Trying to be clear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we’re explaining what we’re doing as designers working on responsive sites, speaking in terms of “browser windows” helps clients (bosses, stakeholders, coworkers, whatever…) understand what we’re really doing. It helps them understand what we can and can’t detect, what we do and do not have control over and help us collectively truly embrace a responsive device-agnostic approach. We need to take care with the language we use, and choose accuracy, even if it means we sometimes have to educate others, over the dumbing-down which inevitably results in expectations we can’t, and don’t want to, meet.&lt;/p&gt;

        Hi Laura,

Great post, referring to the browser when talking about RWD makes a lot of sense. I’ve heard “mobile-first” miss used a lot at my office. This post should help clear up some confusion.
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Sass for designers — the talk and the case study</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/sass-for-designers-the-talk-and-the-case-study/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2013 09:00:10 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/sass-for-designers-the-talk-and-the-case-study/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I gave a talk at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://environmentsforhumans.com/2013/css-summit/&#34;&gt;fantastic online conference CSS Summit&lt;/a&gt; on ‘Sass for designers’. It uses &lt;a href=&#34;http://webtalkdogwalk.in/brighton/&#34;&gt;my new site Web Talk Dog Walk&lt;/a&gt; as a case study, and explains the basics of Sass and how to get started using &lt;a href=&#34;http://incident57.com/codekit/&#34;&gt;CodeKit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually I wouldn’t recommend checking out my slides, as they’re useless without me explaining them, but as this was an online conference and I wanted the slides to be extra clear in case of technical problems, they hopefully read in a fairly easy-to-follow way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/conferences/#post-3873&#34;&gt;See the Sass for designers slides on my Conferences page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also made &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/laurakalbag/webtalkdogwalk&#34;&gt;most of the site code (the stuff not covered by other people’s licenses!) available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve tried to make the commits fit in with the slides as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edits: the very kind &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roy/status/360670152855011328&#34;&gt;Roy Tomeij&lt;/a&gt; wrote a post about &lt;a href=&#34;http://roytomeij.com/2013/should-you-use-a-sass-mixin-or-extend.html&#34;&gt;when to use mixins vs @extend in Sass&lt;/a&gt; following my talk. I didn’t know much about @extend, but now I do! So &lt;a href=&#34;http://roytomeij.com/2013/should-you-use-a-sass-mixin-or-extend.html&#34;&gt;this is some additional recommended reading&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy Spicer also asked if I could share my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/&#34;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt; mockups for the site design. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/s/13tfiy8xzworplz/Web%20talk%20dog%20walk%20mockup.zip&#34;&gt;You can download the zipped .sketch file here&lt;/a&gt;. I use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/beta/&#34;&gt;the latest version of the Sketch beta&lt;/a&gt;, so you’ll need to use this to open the file as it may not be compatible with older versions.&lt;/p&gt;

        A good wee article Laura. Always interested in seeing other workflows. The more I read about Sass, the more powerful it gets. 

Until recently I didn’t know about placeholder selectors. Also, with RWD projects I’ve moved my breakpoint calls into a mixin and passing the breakpoint by a variable.

So many great tools out there at the moment :-)
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Responsive Day Out</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/responsive-day-out/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2013 22:52:39 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/responsive-day-out/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em style=&#34;opacity: 0.9;&#34;&gt;A month ago I spoke at &lt;a href=&#34;http://responsiveconf.com/&#34;&gt;Responsive Day Out&lt;/a&gt;, an “affordable, enjoyable gathering of UK designers and developers sharing their workflow strategies, techniques, and experiences with responsive web design.” As I said to &lt;a href=&#34;http://adactio.com&#34;&gt;Jeremy Keith&lt;/a&gt; when he first asked me if I wanted to do it, this would be a day I couldn’t possibly miss, regardless of speaking. It very much lived up to my expectations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em style=&#34;opacity: 0.9;&#34;&gt;After a whole month of mulling over the talks in my head, and chatting to other people who were there or who have listened to the talks since (&lt;a href=&#34;http://responsiveconf.com/&#34;&gt;you can listen to them here&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.besquare.me/conferences/responsive-day-out/&#34;&gt;watch them on BeSquare&lt;/a&gt;), I’ve joined a lot of dots in my head. I had intended to publish this writeup just a few days after the event, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/burnout/&#34; title=&#34;Burnout&#34;&gt;burnout&lt;/a&gt; and a whole lot of client work got on top of me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em style=&#34;opacity: 0.9;&#34;&gt;Even though it’s a month later, I still wanted to share all of these great things I learned on that day. This writeup has now become a writeup-reflection. Do I still feel excited by these things a month later? How did these talks affect my work over the next month?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hugeness-that-is-responsive-web-design&#34;&gt;The hugeness that is Responsive Web Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elliot Jay Stocks described Responsive Web Design as being about “making your site accessible and adaptable to any device, regardless of the design.” Bruce Lawson described it as “make it work everywhere or else you’re a walrus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a seemingly niche subject for a day-long conference, the amount covered in this day was huge. As Mark Boulton put it in the closing talk, responsive web design is, in a way, bigger than web standards. It disrupts far more industries than our own. The subtleties in the markup that we write is only visible to us as developers, but responsive web design has an effect on any user of the web, and any industry that has a presence on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite having such a huge impact on modern web design, there wasn’t anyone really preaching that responsive web design is the “one true solution”. One of the first points David Bushell made was that if a site that isn’t optimised for small viewports and isn’t too hard to browse on mobile, then it’s worth considering whether an alternative is really worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;all-the-devices&#34;&gt;All the devices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the dawn of Responsive Design (and before that, really) we seemed to focus on making our sites work on particular mobile devices. Namely the iPhone. It made life easier as we just had to design for a few more specific widths of websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the speakers at Responsive Day Out spoke about how we need to break away from designing for specific devices, as you’ll never be able to cater for every user, and there is no average, normal or most common viewport width or capabilities. In his talk about future-friendly browser support, Tom Maslen posited that there are far too many edge cases (almost every device is an edge case in some way) to take this approach, and that you have no idea what’s going to come out next week or next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re never going to win, you’re playing the wrong game…” David Bushell on designing for devices&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Device detection isn’t futureproof. Avoid.” Anna Debenham on designing for devices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2013/04/devicedetection.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-2737&#34;&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Tom Maslen pointed out, we’re foolish focusing on devices. Before responsive design, did we ever talk about whether a website worked on a particular Dell PC or a MacBook? We didn’t, we thought in terms of browsers and whether our sites worked in Internet Explorer 8 or the most recent version of Firefox. This makes it much easier to test and gives us a much narrower set of requirements that our sites need to fulfil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Bushell explained how screen size doesn’t equate to viewport size, as many desktop users, especially those with very large displays, will use browser windows much narrower than their screen. Something that I also touched on in my talk was that you can’t judge what device is being used, or what user is doing based on the size of their viewport. A narrower viewport does not necessarily guarantee a mobile device, or low bandwidth or that the user is “on the go”. A narrower viewport could just mean that the user has stuck the browser window to one side of their enormous display on a high-end Mac, using broadband while at work in their office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;breakpoints-and-tweakpoints&#34;&gt;Breakpoints and tweakpoints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the speakers discussed breakpoints, but not obsessing over them as the defining feature of Responsive Web Design. While most of us have been guilty of basing breakpoints on particular (Apple!) devices, the focus was on moving away from device-based breakpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Boulton suggested that breakpoints should be based on changing user experiences based on the features and capabilities of the browser; using “macro breakpoints” when something big happens, such as a layout change, and mostly basing your CSS around “micro breakpoints”, on the little tweaking details that add up to 80% of your styles. These are very much along the same lines as &lt;a href=&#34;http://adactio.com/journal/6044/&#34;&gt;Jeremy Keith’s “tweakpoints”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my talk I shared my ideas of basing breakpoints around the optimal display of the content, as every content element has an ideal maximum width and and ideal minimum width. Using the content in this way ensures the best browsing experience, as well as using constraints derived from the one thing that won’t change in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruce Lawson also touched on making assumptions about types of user interaction based on viewport size. Bruce gave the example of browsing a site on a TV. Whilst the TV screen is very large, the distance at which you sit from it makes the interaction more akin to using a mobile device, they occupy the same space in your field of vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-just-screens-but-inputs&#34;&gt;Not just screens, but inputs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna Debenham’s talk on consoles showed us the wide range of web browsing experiences on gaming devices, and how the inputs and interactions on these devices have a huge impact on the browsing experience. Combinations of touch screen and voice input, stylus wielding, button hitting, pointer waving and joystick nudging can make the web a challenging experience on consoles, however Anna emphasised that designing specifically for these devices isn’t the way forward. These &lt;a href=&#34;http://console.maban.co.uk/&#34;&gt;devices are rapidly improving their support for web standards&lt;/a&gt;, so building a site with web standards, multiple contexts and accessibility in mind will inevitably result in a site that’s a joy to use on a console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t design for consoles, design for everything and nothing.” Jeremy Keith summing up in the panel session after Anna’s talk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;designing-for-features-and-capabilities&#34;&gt;Designing for features and capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Boulton, Andy Hume and Tom Maslen all spoke about designing for features and capabilities instead of devices. This is tied in with the idea of &lt;a href=&#34;http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement&#34;&gt;progressive enhancement&lt;/a&gt;, which many of us have been using as a web development mantra for years. Tom Maslen named his talk after the technique of judging browsers which “cut the mustard.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cutting-the-mustard&#34;&gt;Cutting the mustard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom Maslen and Andy Hume both work on large news sites (&lt;a href=&#34;http://bbc.co.uk&#34;&gt;bbc.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://guardian.co.uk&#34;&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;) and so shared their experiences of practically applying responsive design to huge content-heavy sites. Their technique of “cutting the mustard” is to define a list of browsers deemed to be ‘modern’, with a certain set of features and capabilities, and then delivering a progressively enhanced experience to those browsers only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique relies on building a simple core experience where the content is accessible from any device. Andy suggested there are three stages of the page load, where only one is vital:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“content”: HTML and CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“enhancement”: javascript which enhances the experience with rich/interactive media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“leftovers”: analytics, ads, and anything else which is least important to the users but useful to include on the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom pointed out that using this technique would mean no time wasted on polyfilling, or other ways of trying to make the older/less capable browsers support the same enhancements. As the browsers that cut the mustard all support modern standards, you can be assured of a good level of support for CSS and other modern technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is far easier to manage than the BBC’s previous strategy of supporting a specific table of browsers, using graceful degradation to give a similar experience to all users. This was all easy enough when all browsers were free, uncomplicated and easy to test; where you could test most browsers on either a PC or Mac, but now you need to invest in an enormous array of devices to test on every browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2013/04/browsercompatibility.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-2729&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;more-markup-and-code&#34;&gt;More markup and code&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The web and web standards have always been responsive”-Bruce Lawson on how the web is inherently flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruce Lawson started his talk saying that we constrained ourselves on the web. Mark Boulton later pointed out that we didn’t really constrain ourselves, we’ve been using the web for everything and anything when it was really just designed for memos. The web wasn’t &lt;strong&gt;designed&lt;/strong&gt; to be inherently flexible, it just happened that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fluid-design&#34;&gt;Fluid design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Bruce was really highlighting the fact that we could have been developing sites based on fluid layouts for years, it’s just that most of us have been falsely constraining ourselves with fixed-width layouts in order to give us more control. Throughout the day, Jeremy Keith relished in telling us how he’d always worked in this way and how it made the move to responsive layouts significantly easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy Hume spoke of an ideal future where every component of a site would be standalone, as a modular part of a greater system. Building our sites in this way would mean we didn’t even need to rely on media queries. If we built our components to suit any width, embracing fluidity, they would fit any device without forcing particular responsive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;all-the-css-possibilities&#34;&gt;All the CSS possibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruce Lawson introduced us to a huge amount of existing and up-and-coming standards that we’ll be able to use to make responsive design much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;viewport-meta-and-viewport&#34;&gt;Viewport meta and @viewport&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruce explained how the viewport meta tag &lt;code&gt;meta name=&amp;quot;viewport&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;width=device-width&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; is a bit of a blunt instrument, and how it’s really mixing presentation into our structure as it’s telling pages how to display from within the HTML and not the CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruce showed us a potential solution using an &lt;a href=&#34;http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/an-introduction-to-meta-viewport-and-viewport/&#34;&gt;@viewport rule&lt;/a&gt; in your CSS which could replace the viewport meta tag and allow for more sophisticated combinations of viewport and media query rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-next-level-css&#34;&gt;Some next level CSS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the cheeky name of “CSS Level 4”, Bruce walked us through some proposed additional media queries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;(script)&lt;/code&gt; which can be used to provide fallbacks or enhancements based on whether the browser supports JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supported inputs and interactions such as &lt;code&gt;(touch)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;(hover)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;(remote)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(keyboard)&lt;/code&gt; which can be used to optimise the user experience based on the capabilities of their device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These could be used to replace the functionality of something like &lt;a href=&#34;http://modernizr.com/&#34;&gt;Modernizr, where JavaScript is used to detect browser capabilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;flexbox&#34;&gt;Flexbox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2013/04/flexbox.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2741&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2013/04/flexbox.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Bruce Lawson talking about flexbox&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/flexbox-basics/&#34;&gt;Flexbox&lt;/a&gt;, as shown by Bruce, is so full of exciting potential for CSS layouts. The rules associated with flexbox gives layout superpowers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reorder content on the page without changing the hierarchy of the HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make content redistribute across any given space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;centre content horizontally or vertically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create complex grid layouts without having to rely on dodgy class names or endless floating elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruce warned us to be wary of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://css-tricks.com/old-flexbox-and-new-flexbox/&#34;&gt;differences between the 2009 and 2011 flexbox syntaxes&lt;/a&gt;, as both are implemented differently across browsers, although a standard is being reached with the later syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pesky-prefixes&#34;&gt;Pesky prefixes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruce emphasised that, when using any of these new CSS features, to always make sure you use both the prefixed (for browser vendor implementation testing) and unprefixed (the desired web standard) versions of each rule. This ensures current compatibility with browsers-in-flux but also future compatibility when all browsers consistently support the standard in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;performance&#34;&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance was a key word of the day. Many speakers mentioned how we’ve been spoilt by broadband, and seemed to have forgotten about optimising our sites for limited bandwidth and poor connections. This has come back to bite us as we realise how much our weighty sites impact upon the mobile experience on responsively designed sites. Andy Hume pointed out that performance isn’t just about responsive design, it’s important for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; design, and that responsive design has just put the light on our previously bad practices. Anna Debenham suggested that we should set a performance budget for each page, which we use to ensure that our resources aren’t getting out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;images&#34;&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Responsive images” are a common request among designers and developers. Really what most people want is a clever way to add flexibility to images, and some kind of browser magic to deliver the relevant image to suit the user’s bandwidth. Paul Robert Lloyd proposed that appropriate use of imagery is a more realistic solution. Paul questioned whether we really need to use images as much as we do, and maybe we should be working with truly scalable media. Paul posited that the element is an unrealistic solution as it gives developers the idea that you can aim for pixel perfection on the web when, especially in the world of varying-DPI displays, it’s just not achievable. When considering the best solutions for images, Paul put images into three categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decorative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;asset-fonts&#34;&gt;Asset fonts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where images meet fonts, Josh Emerson spoke about using asset fonts for one-colour graphic elements. Much like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/fonts/webdings/default.htm&#34;&gt;Webdings icons font&lt;/a&gt;, Josh explained that asset fonts could be created as your own set of scaling icons. The glyphs are much easier to manage than &lt;a href=&#34;http://alistapart.com/article/sprites&#34;&gt;hacky image sprites&lt;/a&gt;, they’re supported by &lt;a href=&#34;http://caniuse.com/#feat=fontface&#34;&gt;any browser that supports web fonts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and provide resolution-independent sharp graphics that work on &lt;strong&gt;any-DPI&lt;/strong&gt; display, not just retina displays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2013/04/assetfonts.jpg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh pointed out that, whilst asset fonts are a fantastic solution for vector-style graphics, images that require more than one colour are better served by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics&#34;&gt;SVG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way of delivering assets through fonts are with ligature asset fonts. Josh talked about &lt;a href=&#34;http://symbolset.com/&#34;&gt;Symbolset&lt;/a&gt;, where words can be converted semantically into icons using the ligature format built into fonts. I previously thought that this would be tricky, as you’d have to use the exact language and exact words in your content to trigger the correct icons, which could result in your copy following your design, not separating content and presentation. Josh pointed out that you can use this same ligature formatting to build ligature asset fonts for yourself, using the words and graphics that you want. Unfortunately, ligature asset fonts do require &lt;a href=&#34;http://caniuse.com/#feat=ttf&#34;&gt;OpenType ligature support which is still slightly patchy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;typography&#34;&gt;Typography&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of talk of typography throughout the day as our excitement with two of the biggest turning points in web development in the last few years; web fonts and responsive web design, were brought together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;typography-first&#34;&gt;Typography first&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my talk, I spoke about how text makes up so much of web design that typography, and your choice of typeface, could be the one thing that makes your design feel consistent across any viewport or device. With the web font support we have nowadays, or even using a basic palette of “web safe” fonts, you could easily give your website a distinctive voice and atmosphere without the need for complex responsive layouts, just embracing the built-in fluidity of the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;web-fonts-and-fallbacks&#34;&gt;Web fonts and fallbacks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Rutter spoke about how we could improve the experience of web fonts. Richard pointed out the problems that occur when there’s no visible text until the weighty-but-beautiful web font loads. Richard saw it as us having four options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2013/04/webfontoptions.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-2757&#34;&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default: text appears as each web font loads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t send web fonts to small screens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show text in the fallback fonts until all the web fonts load&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swap out the fallback font as each web font loads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a day of speakers talking about how we can’t guess the performance of a browser based solely on viewport size, it seemed like not sending web fonts to small screens was a very general solution which you would have to weigh up with the probability of narrow viewports equating to low bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard talked about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://24ways.org/2010/using-the-webfont-loader-to-make-browsers-behave-the-same/&#34;&gt;WebFont Loader&lt;/a&gt; which gives you JavaScript classes to make all browsers load fonts in the same way, and give you more fine-grained control on when and how the fonts appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard emphasised the importance of operating system font fallbacks for web fonts, and how these could be used as a very workable, readable version of a page until the web fonts are loaded. The knack to getting this right is to make the fallback fonts as similar as possible to the web font. This involves researching the most appropriate fallback fonts on different devices, and tweaking the metrics of the fallback font to best match the web font size and shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;layouts-and-navigation&#34;&gt;Layouts and navigation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;differentiating-and-uniting&#34;&gt;Differentiating and uniting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main focus of my talk was trying to get our heads round how our visual designs respond to responsiveness, and how we can use this to create good and familiar experiences no matter what the viewport. I spoke about design systems, and how our visual systems are built from typography, layout, colour and shape/form. When considering each of these modules, we should consider what works to unite the feel of our site across different viewports and what we must differentiate in order to optimise the experience for different viewport widths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;antiphonal-geometry&#34;&gt;Antiphonal geometry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owen Gregory spoke about how we can’t base web design layouts on print geometry as our materials are just not the same. Print is static, but the web is the complete opposite. Owen pointed out that we can keep using geometric layouts, they just have to be made flexible. Whilst Mark Boulton spoke about not constraining ourselves with frames that we create ourselves, Owen talked about how these frames are ever-present without our input, every device uses frames to deliver content in the form of a screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owen agreed with Mark in that we can’t use frames as false constraints, we must acknowledge that we can’t possibly guess what size these frames are going to be, but Owen also pointed out that the ratios between the height and width of many devices are roughly the same, so we could potentially use these values in our designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2013/04/control.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2733&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2013/04/control.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mark Boulton on Control&#34;/&gt;
	
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On reflection, this was an exciting revelation to many of us (the similarity between the ratios) but I still disagree with this as something to design around. There may well be similarities between the proportions &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt;, but the point of embracing the responsiveness of the web and not focusing on specific devices is that we don’t know what those proportions will be in the near or distant future. For now, this may be the most aesthetically pleasing ratio, but our tastes could well change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owen spoke about the similarities between the ratios of device proportions and the harmony of musical intervals. This is similar to Tim Brown’s talk I saw at Ampersand conference 2011 (also &lt;a href=&#34;http://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography&#34;&gt;a fantastic article on A List Apart&lt;/a&gt;) about using typography built on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://modularscale.com/&#34;&gt;modular scale based on musical intervals&lt;/a&gt;. These principles use the interval harmonies found in music, which is &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number&#34;&gt;can also be found in maths and nature&lt;/a&gt;, to create scales for your typographic hierarchy which has that same harmonious and balanced feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;types-of-navigation&#34;&gt;Types of navigation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Bushell got into the meat of responsive navigation. Despite showing us many different types of navigation, David emphasised that we shouldn’t try to be too clear with our navigation, as we’ll likely just end up confusing the users. We must remember that the reason navigation exists is to make it easy for the user to find what they’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, David suggested we should aim for as few menu items as possible. The navigation menu isn’t the only form of discoverability on a site, so we don’t need to cram everything in there. We’re risking all of the site on a single point of failure if we only have a single point of navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to bear in mind that it’s not just the mouse or keyboard that we’re trying to accommodate, we must make navigation work with any form of input. Still, any interaction made with any of these forms of input is, in essence, the equivalent of one click-event and so still requires effort from the user and potentially slowing the user down with more page loads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2013/04/typesofinput.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-2753&#34;&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of the different types of navigation David talked about were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a print-style table of contents which makes the content hierarchy very clear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jumping to a ‘big footer’, where you’ve no limitations on the amount of navigation as it’s not above, or hiding, the primary content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hiding and revealing the navigation, above or to one side of the primary content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overlaying the navigation over the primary content, so it’s not pushing the content down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multiple tiers of sub-menus, allowing the user to drill down to what they’re looking for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;just simply using menu items floating side-by-side, with clever breakpoints to optimise their readability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-hamburger-icon&#34;&gt;The “hamburger” icon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David’s talk was the first where I’d heard the description of three horizontal lines as the “hamburger” icon. David spoke about this icon as a potential convention that’s arising in responsive design, as it’s used by some very large mainstream sites with a wide audience. However, it’s possibly being used as an easy option for designers looking to hide a menu button in as small a space as possible, without considering whether it’s really the best and easiest-to-understand option for the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-matter-of-process&#34;&gt;A matter of process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Process is one of the trickiest topics in responsive design. Both Elliot Jay Stocks and I spoke about how hard it is for us to let go of the tried-and-tested processes that worked for us for so long. Sarah Parmenter described our processes themselves as being adaptive, and how our the task of creating good working processes will never truly be done. Sarah said it was a problem of workflow, and we need to find workflows that work for us as individuals. Elliot Jay Stocks pointed out that once we rethink our processes, responsive design will no longer be described as such a time-consuming process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;communication&#34;&gt;Communication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my talk, I tried to emphasise that a lot of our problems with responsive design stem from our focus on the deliverables, and mockups, that we produce for clients. We need to remember &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; we create these mockups in the first place, that they’re really just tools for communication our ideas and concepts. We need to let go of the perfectionism in our mockups and focus on presenting our ideas to our clients and colleagues in an efficient way which also helps us visualise our own work effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;designers-who-can-code&#34;&gt;Designers who can code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elliot Jay Stocks pointed out the value in being a designer who can code. Being able to code means that you’re not stuck in the static format of a graphics editor. You may not be an amazing front-end developer, but being able to code will make it so much easier to communicate the responsive elements of your design work to your clients and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;content-content-content&#34;&gt;Content, content, content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he was speaking about designing navigation, David Bushell pointed out that knowing your content hierarchy is incredibly important for understanding the best form of navigation. Placeholder content is not a viable substitute as you just don’t know what you’re designing around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many speakers went back to this point. In my talk I returned to it when I said that the whole purpose of a site is to present the content in an optimal experience, so we really need the content before we can make decisions on the most appropriate form of presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah Parmenter quoted Mark Boulton saying that you need to know the content structure, not just the content. Sarah spoke about the importance of a content audit, and really knowing your content structure. Sarah had the idea of getting clients to not sign off on visual mockups or wireframes, but on the content hierarchy, where the importance of each element was agreed with the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Robert Lloyd described it as meaning being our baseline. Aesthetic design is just an enhancement. On the most basic level, the HTML page of content is a usable website. Anything we put on top of that basic usability must be carefully considered so that it adds to, rather than damages, the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;approaches-and-attitudes&#34;&gt;Approaches and attitudes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the month since Responsive Day Out, I’ve heard the term “winging it” over and over. It was Sarah Parmenter kicking the day off saying “we’re winging it” that initiated this kind of group honesty where everyone felt they could share what they &lt;strong&gt;didn’t&lt;/strong&gt; know about responsive design. I’ve noticed people starting to be more free with their ideas and experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;not-being-comfortable&#34;&gt;Not being comfortable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Boulton ended the day on the point that we need to stop trying to be comfortable with what we’re doing. We need to start feeling comfortable with feeling uncomfortable. We previously gave ourselves false constraints to make our lives easier, and to make our work feel like it fitted. These constraints have done nothing but cause us problems with future compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feeling of uncertainty is here for good, and it’s a valuable part of ensuring we make our sites better for those unpredictable situations.&lt;/p&gt;

        Listened to your appearance on Unfinished biz yesterday where you mentioned the hamberger icon. I beleive it’s a morphed stylised list –; without the dots. With the dots the icon actually looks like a list –; which navigation mostly is but without the dots gets people confused –; so a hamburger is appropriate as thats confusing as there is no ham (those these days you can’t really tell) (And for those saying Hamburgers are from Hamberg –; where are beefburgers from?)  

Thanks for doing the write up –; you have picked up (researched) a lot more links than I remember on the day so it will be good to return to this post again and again.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Thanks for such a thorough analysis and reflection of Responsive Day Out, and thanks also for engaging with the ideas in my talk, something other correspondents haven’t really done –; I think many commentators didn’t really know what to make of it!

I’d like to respond, however and clarify a few points. If this stuff wasn’t clear from my talk, then I apologize; I had to cram a lot into the twenty minutes and knew very well that I had to simply miss things out or leave them unexplained.

I wouldn’t characterize using the principles and implications of antiphonal geometry as creating “geometric layouts”, more that such an approach encourages web designers to take and use certain aspects of visual design they might think aren’t available to them in a fluid medium: namely, the ratios of the screens that necessarily frame our work.

I certainly didn’t intend to say that the aspect ratios of the screens we use are “roughly the same”. 3:5 isn’t 5:8. But for each distinct ratio there are several different devices, from smartphone to desktop screen; the iPhone 5, for example, shares the same aspect ratio as the Thunderbolt display. Far from “focusing on specific devices”, the principles of antiphonal geometry allow us to use properties that devices share, not set them apart.

I tried to make clear that there is a set of aspect ratios used for web screens (2:3, 3:4, 3:5, and so on) that matches natural musical harmonic intervals, so why not use those values to inform our designs. The main idea is that when the screen aspect ratio is 3:4, for example, we use that to change parts of a visual design. And when the aspect ratio changes, so too can the design. Using musical harmony is merely an interesting (well, I think so!) extension of that.

Of course, you’re right to say that “we don’t know what those proportions will be in the near or distant future”, but I believe we’ll continue to see the same set of proportions in screen aspect ratios for many years to come.

Also, I never intended that these ideas be “something to design around.” I wouldn’t design with these principles in mind from the start, but I might apply some of them where appropriate to help create a resonance between the design and the device it’s displayed on.

I hope that clears a few things up. I might try to write up my complete take on antiphonal geometry eventually, and set it out as clearly as I can, for anyone willing to take the risk! Thank you again for your thoughts.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was a guest on &lt;a href=&#34;http://upfrontpodcast.com/2013/02/15/episode4.html&#34;&gt;the Upfront podcast with the lovely Jack Franklin and Ben Howdle&lt;/a&gt;. They got me on to talk about accessibility, but we ended up chatting about the mentoring project too! You can &lt;a href=&#34;http://upfrontpodcast.com/2013/02/15/episode4.html&#34;&gt;listen on their website&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/upfront-podcast/id598389212?mt=2&#34;&gt;listen and subscribe on iTunes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
