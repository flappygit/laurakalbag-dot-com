      <description>&lt;p&gt;A weird experiment that almost works…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4954-small.jpg&#34;&gt;

		**Sleeping in Spring.** Mucking about with overlaying a couple of photos. It’s a bit more editing than multiple exposures, but a similar style. I was just flicking through the layer blending modes and found something that looked a bit different. Here I’ve layered a couple of blending modes and erased some areas to bring Oskar’s face out
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photography on manual: 10 –; Miscellaneous</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/photography-on-manual-10-miscellaneous/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last few days have brought a very miscellaneous collection of photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4833-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4737&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4833-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A Rama figurine, standing in pebbles on Brighton beach&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Rama on the beach.** I was out trying to get the sea and the pier, but the weather was grim, and I found this little figure instead. I think it might be Rama, but I might be wrong…
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next photo is part of our overlaying exercise set by Ashley. I did it in post-processing, before I discovered that my camera has a multiple exposure setting. It’s pretty cheesy, but an okay first try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4869-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4738&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4869-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Profile of Aral, overlaid on purple and blue clouds in the sky&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Overlay.** Aral and the sky. Looks a bit film poster…
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4894-small.jpg&#34;&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Grove.** The tree outside the back of our house looks like it’s glowing at night.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photography on manual: 9 –; Oskar in the grey</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/photography-on-manual-9-oskar-in-the-grey/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2015 15:20:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/photography-on-manual-9-oskar-in-the-grey/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week we’ve been looking more at natural light, and portraits with foreground detail. I took my trusty (actually incredibly unreliable) model, Oskar, out for a walk and hounded him with the camera. It was a very grey day, but with a lot of light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4660-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4730&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4660-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Oskar the dog amongst cow parsley plants&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Oskar in the cow parsley.** It’s much easier to get a shot in focus when the model is sitting still! I’m pleased with the depth from the different layers of cow parsley.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4677-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4731&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4677-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Oskar the dog walking on grass&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Oskar walking.** Trying to rotate the shot to make it feel less wonky meant it ended up quite closely cropped.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4721-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4732&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4721-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Oskar the dog in the hedgerow, with blue flowers and weeds in the foreground&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Oskar in the hedgerow.** I used Ashley’s trick of picking some weeds and holding them in front of the camera.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photography on manual: 8 –; Traffic and Jess</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/photography-on-manual-8-traffic-and-jess/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2015 08:39:23 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/photography-on-manual-8-traffic-and-jess/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our most recent exercise was to take a long exposure shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4517-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4687&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4517-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Streaks of light on a road caused by traffic  during a long exposure.&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Seafront traffic.** I wandered around for a while, trying to find a good angle from a height, but the traffic was too quiet! The main sea front road was much better, though it was pretty windy last night, so it’s slightly blurrier that I’d like on the static objects.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that, Ashley gave us a great tutorial on using natural light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4365-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4688&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4365-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;My sister, Jess, sitting in front of a window looking down.&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Jess.** After reading Ashley’s email on light, I stalked my family around windows. I lightened Jess’s face up a bit, and removed the distracting toasted on the window sill. It’s a bit of an odd crop, but I didn’t want any of the junk in the background.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photography on manual: 7 –; Small Cat</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/photography-on-manual-7-small-cat/</link>

      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/photography-on-manual-7-small-cat/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My parents’ cat, called Milly. Who I call “Small Cat” because she’s so small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4326-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4684&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4326-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Small grey and brown tabby/tortoiseshell cat lying on grass in the garden&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Small Cat.** I edited out the wonky lamp in the background because it was distracting. I also muted the grass and plants so her scary green eyes would be more noticeable.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photography on manual: 6 –; Walk</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/photography-on-manual-6-walk/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2015 16:33:49 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/photography-on-manual-6-walk/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started doing this course, I knew I’d probably end up with a lot of dog walking photos. Oskar and I are out every day, and so there’s lots of photo opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/photography-on-manual-5-levitation/&#34;&gt;exploring the self-timer in my last photo&lt;/a&gt;, I thought I’d try it again. Dog photos are obviously great, but I wanted something to show how we exist as a pair. Also outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4196-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4682&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4196-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Me and Oskar the dog, sitting together on a bench on the horizon of a big park&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**East Brighton rest.** I knocked the grass back a bit, as it was very bright, and I brought out the blue in the sky with curves.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photography on manual: 5 –; Levitation</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/photography-on-manual-5-levitation/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2015 17:01:56 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/photography-on-manual-5-levitation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another photo post so soon? Yes! It’s the weekend, and Ashley gave us a really cool new exercise to try levitation, so I thought I had to try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4078-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4680&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF4078-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A photo of me levitating in front of a window, with my arms and legs floating around.&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Levitation.** This took SO MANY tries. The light changed while I was setting up, so it was a bit tricky to edit the two originals together. I tried to crop out the most distracting elements of the shot, and desaturate the rest.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photography on manual: 4 –; Post-processing</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/photography-on-manual-4-post-processing/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2015 07:53:33 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/photography-on-manual-4-post-processing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On my last day in Berlin, I took a lot more photos. Last night I started post-processing them, following Ashley’s email and video tutorials. Post-processing is an area where I have more experience, I’ve done a lot of Photoshopping in the past, but now I’m trying to achieve new effects using Lightroom, which is a very different animal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3765-original-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4675&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3765-original-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Me taking a photo in a mirror in a hotel room&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Me in a hotel room, original.** Travelling in Berlin, and being a bit slow to set up shots, I found my only (mostly) willing model was me. I found it really hard to get the focus on my face, so my hands are slightly crisper.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3765-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4676&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3765-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Me taking a photo in a mirror in a hotel room&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		In post-processing, I cropped out the most distracting parts of the shot, and straightened the bottom line of the mirror slightly. I adjusted the white balance so the lighting feels more natural. Using Ashley’s eye pop tutorial, I tweaked my eyes, but because my irises are almost black, I looked a bit scary if I lightened them!
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3839-original-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4677&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3839-original-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Street sign saying ‘Reichpietschufer’ in front of a chestnut tree&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Reichpietschufer, original.** It was a bright but overcast day, so the original was high contrast but a bit dull.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3839-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4678&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3839-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Street sign saying ‘Reichpietschufer’ in front of a chestnut tree&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Reichpietschufer.** I wanted to soften it a little in post-processing, so it has a bit more of a retro feel. I also straightened it so the sign is along a properly horizontal line.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photography on manual: 3 –; Day One at re:publica</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/photography-on-manual-3-republica-day-one/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, the Ind.ie team are at re:publica in Berlin, so I’m getting lots of opportunities to take photos that aren’t just of the dog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3596-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4668&#34;&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3538-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4672&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3538-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A projected luminous anti-gun symbol on a floor&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Projection.** A very abstract photo.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3603-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4669&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3603-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Big hallway with lots of seats and a stage at one end. A few people in the distance.&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**STG-1 (Stage 1) at re:publica.** A fairly dark location, lit very strongly at one end. I managed to get a blurry walking man against it all.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3612-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4670&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3612-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Close up photo of Aral Balkan&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Close up Aral.** Chopped the top of his head off, and he’s a bit coloured by the red light. I’m pleased I managed to get his face in focus, though it’s stronger around his mouth, whereas I guess the eyes is where we should be aiming for sharpness?
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;

      <title>Photography on manual: 2 –; Splash</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/photography-splash/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2015 19:37:04 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first exercise we’ve been given is to capture a splash in a cup…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3495-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4663&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3495-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tea splashing out of a mug on the kitchen floor&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**First splash.** My kitchen is in a basement, so it’s a little bit dark. Even with the ISO jacked all the way up, this was the lightest I could get with the fastest possible shutter speed.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3521-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4664&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3521-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tea splashing out of a mug, outdoors on a patio&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Second splash.** So I went outside! Unfortunately my burst caught the splash a bit late.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3527-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4665&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3527-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tea splashing out of a mug, outdoors on a patio. Plant pot on the left.&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Best splash.** Finally got the hang of it. Though I wonder if the plant pot on the left spoils the composition.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3527-square-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4666&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3527-square-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tea splashing out of a mug, outdoors on a patio. Square crop.&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Best splash, cropped.** If I crop the pot out, but keep it landscape, I cut too much of the splash out. I’m not sure if square works either.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photography on manual: 1</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/photography-on-manual-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2015 12:27:28 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://laurakalbag.com/photography-on-manual-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a DSLR for nearly a year now. And I still only ever use it on the Auto modes. I studied photography (with film cameras) during my Art Foundation course ~10 years ago, but I think any decent photos were mostly luck, and I can’t remember much of it. So when Ashley set up her &lt;a href=&#34;http://girlwithacamera.co.uk/courses/&#34;&gt;Girl With A Camera Course&lt;/a&gt;, “For the beginner photographer who wants to pick up their camera more,” I was instantly sold!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next month, I’m going to try to blog some of my photos taken during Ashley’s exercises (and hopefully lots more that I’ve taken for fun!) Maybe I’ll be able to ditch the Auto modes by the end of it. I’ve not edited any of these photos yet, as tempting as it is, as I want to wait til we get to that bit of the course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first task was to switch my camera to manual…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3427-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4656&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3427-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;All-black dark shot&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**First photo on manual**. Fallen at the first hurdle, I turned my settings on to manual and fiddled with the shutter speed and aperture but couldn’t seem to get any exposure at all.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3442-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4657&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3442-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo of Oskar the dog curled up on the sofa, with a blurry background&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Narrow depth of field**. Following the examples in Ashley’s email, I tried to get a narrow depth of field on Oskar. The shadow in the room made it a bit awkward, as your eyes are drawn to his leg rather than his head, but at least the background is blurry!
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3446-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4658&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3446-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo of back of tall higgledy-piggledy regency buildings&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Narrow aperture**. To mimic the landscape shot, I was a bit lazy and looked out of our back window. The built-up buildings round here are pretty maze-like.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3450-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4659&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3450-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mostly blurry photo of Oskar the dog scratching&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Shutter speed 1**. These next few shots were playing with the shutter speed to see what would be blurry, and what would be sharp. I couldn’t seem to get any of them very sharp!
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3456-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4660&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3456-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Quite blurry photo of Oskar the dog scratching&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Shutter speed 2**. The sharpest of the Osky shots.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3468-small.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter size-full wp-image-4661&#34;&gt;
	
		&lt;img src=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/images/2015/05/DSCF3468-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Blurry photo of Oskar the dog scratching&#34;/&gt;
	
	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		**Shutter speed 3**. The blurriest of the Osky shots.
		
			
		
		&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also going to try to take more than just dog photos!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week &lt;a href=&#34;http://alistapart.com/column/breaking-stuff&#34;&gt;my latest column, Breaking Stuff&lt;/a&gt;, was published on A List Apart. I’m in a strange transitional period, moving from client work to fulltime at &lt;a href=&#34;https://ind.ie&#34;&gt;ind.ie&lt;/a&gt;, so I think I’ll be writing more about situations like these as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also finally updated that terrible avatar to something much better. I look uncharacteristically pale, but at least I’m normal colours! (Unlike the last terrible photo I’d used.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week my column on Inspiration was published on A List Apart. It follows roughly the same structure as &lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/laurakalbag/inspiration&#34; title=&#34;slides from my talk at Design + Banter&#34;&gt;the talk&lt;/a&gt; I gave at &lt;a href=&#34;http://designandbanter.com&#34;&gt;Design + Banter&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Craig Grannell has written &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/why-industry-mentoring-utterly-invaluable-11410363&#34;&gt;a fantastic article on Creative Bloq about mentoring&lt;/a&gt;, looking at loads of different ways the web industry can do mentoring well. Including interviews with Clare Sutcliffe, Greg Hoy, Jeffery Zeldman, Andy Budd, Josh Emerson, Andy Budd, Anna Debenham and me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s well-worth a read if you want to mentor somebody, or would like to find a mentor yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Design theory for the web, a workshop</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/design-theory-for-the-web-workshop/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a slightly scary thing: I’m doing &lt;a href=&#34;http://makedo.in/design-theory-for-the-web/&#34;&gt;my first solo workshop on the 11th October 2013 in Barnsley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often get asked about the best way to “learn design”, and I usually say that you learn by doing and you learn by watching how others do it. In this workshop, I want to give new designers, developers, and anybody else wanting to learn how to design for the web, a good foundation with five primers, a bit of doing and a bit of watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a low-cost workshop. The early bird tickets are just £125, and the full-price tickets are just £165. Fancy joining me for the day? &lt;a href=&#34;http://makedo.in/design-theory-for-the-web/#nav-register&#34;&gt;Grab a ticket from the makedo site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        Good luck on your first solo workshop, although I’m sure you’ll be great at it.

One thing, how suitable is this for a developer who’s looking to understand more about design? I don’t have much of a design background at all, mostly a server-side developer.

        Thanks Neil :)

It’s absolutely aimed at developers and beginners who are new to designing for the web. More experienced designers might pick up some tips and tricks, but my main focus is the beginners.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead of &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/speaking-at-dare-conference/&#34; title=&#34;Speaking at Dare conference&#34;&gt;speaking at Dare conference&lt;/a&gt; this September, &lt;a href=&#34;http://lucidplot.com/2013/08/05/kalbag-podcast/&#34;&gt;I was interviewed by Jonathan Kahn&lt;/a&gt;, one of Dare’s organisers, about being honest, client relationships and mentoring in the web industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was lovely chatting to Jonathan, and his &lt;a href=&#34;http://lucidplot.com/2013/08/05/kalbag-podcast/&#34;&gt;podcast also has a proper transcript&lt;/a&gt; if you’re more of a reading person than a listening person :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sass for designers — the talk and the case study</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/sass-for-designers-the-talk-and-the-case-study/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I gave a talk at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://environmentsforhumans.com/2013/css-summit/&#34;&gt;fantastic online conference CSS Summit&lt;/a&gt; on ‘Sass for designers’. It uses &lt;a href=&#34;http://webtalkdogwalk.in/brighton/&#34;&gt;my new site Web Talk Dog Walk&lt;/a&gt; as a case study, and explains the basics of Sass and how to get started using &lt;a href=&#34;http://incident57.com/codekit/&#34;&gt;CodeKit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually I wouldn’t recommend checking out my slides, as they’re useless without me explaining them, but as this was an online conference and I wanted the slides to be extra clear in case of technical problems, they hopefully read in a fairly easy-to-follow way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/conferences/#post-3873&#34;&gt;See the Sass for designers slides on my Conferences page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also made &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/laurakalbag/webtalkdogwalk&#34;&gt;most of the site code (the stuff not covered by other people’s licenses!) available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve tried to make the commits fit in with the slides as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edits: the very kind &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roy/status/360670152855011328&#34;&gt;Roy Tomeij&lt;/a&gt; wrote a post about &lt;a href=&#34;http://roytomeij.com/2013/should-you-use-a-sass-mixin-or-extend.html&#34;&gt;when to use mixins vs @extend in Sass&lt;/a&gt; following my talk. I didn’t know much about @extend, but now I do! So &lt;a href=&#34;http://roytomeij.com/2013/should-you-use-a-sass-mixin-or-extend.html&#34;&gt;this is some additional recommended reading&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy Spicer also asked if I could share my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/&#34;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt; mockups for the site design. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/s/13tfiy8xzworplz/Web%20talk%20dog%20walk%20mockup.zip&#34;&gt;You can download the zipped .sketch file here&lt;/a&gt;. I use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/beta/&#34;&gt;the latest version of the Sketch beta&lt;/a&gt;, so you’ll need to use this to open the file as it may not be compatible with older versions.&lt;/p&gt;

        A good wee article Laura. Always interested in seeing other workflows. The more I read about Sass, the more powerful it gets. 

Until recently I didn’t know about placeholder selectors. Also, with RWD projects I’ve moved my breakpoint calls into a mixin and passing the breakpoint by a variable.

So many great tools out there at the moment :-)
    &lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/mentoring-the-evaluation/&#34; title=&#34;Mentoring: the evaluation&#34;&gt;finishing the mentoring project last week&lt;/a&gt;, I had a chat with Craig Grannell about mentoring which he published on the .net website: “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.netmagazine.com/news/laura-kalbag-web-designers-should-mentor-newcomers-132847&#34; title=&#34;Laura Kalbag: web designers should mentor newcomers on .net magazine&#34;&gt;Laura Kalbag: web designers should mentor newcomers&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a good summary of the mentoring project and has extracts from a couple of testimonials by Sibylle and Phil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been four months since we started the mentoring project and now it’s drawing to a close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been very different from what I expected, I didn’t realise I’d learn so much just through explaining to Sibylle, Yago and Phil what I do and why I do it. They really wanted to get to the bottom of the ideal processes when creating sites and working with clients and it made me want to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tricky-areas&#34;&gt;Tricky areas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were three problem areas, all of which could have been overcome with more planning and attention on my part. However I think all of these tricky areas are very much reflective of the problems we come across in everyday project management. Maybe I just need to up my project management skills!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;working-in-a-team-with-strangers&#34;&gt;Working in a team with strangers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that splitting the project tasks across multiple people would lighten the load, but in reality it also required strangers who had never worked together to get to know each other, the best times to work together, and how to collaborate effectively. That’s a huge first step in the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As happens with many client projects, each time they had a face-to-face interaction, or a voice chat, productivity increased. In a remote working environment it can be hard to value the importance of hearing another person’s voice when trying to communicate effectively; seeing facial expressions to understand intent and less formal chatter to just get to know each other better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sharing-roles-and-responsibilities&#34;&gt;Sharing roles and responsibilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I divided the three main tasks for the website project into branding/visual design, front end development, and back end development/WordPress. Despite emphasising that I expected the workload to be spread, with each mentee working as a hybrid, the whole new-to-working-together thing had made this difficult. These roles are not as clear-cut or as simple as they may appear. This led to an unfair, unbalanced workload that was tricky to correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hybridisation&#34;&gt;Hybridisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be a successful freelancer, I strongly believe a designer/developer must be a hybrid with a range of skills and a wide knowledge that they not only need to call on for different projects, but can also use to better inform their work with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in giving each mentee a clear non-hybrid role, I was actively discouraging this with the division of roles. I could ask them to “collaborate” until I was blue in the face, but I hadn’t made it easy to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;time&#34;&gt;Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is what we inevitably struggle with on all projects. This was no different. It’s hard to estimate how long a web project will take, and when nobody in the project is working full-time, it makes it even harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wish I had more time and given more attention to the project. I started out with the best of intentions, I waited until I had some time to dedicate to mentoring. But, as ever, my client work expanded to fill all available space, making it harder to keep a closer eye on process and progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made sure I read every email and Basecamp message; checking in when I thought it necessary and answering every question as quickly as possible. But I could have done a lot better. I could have pre-empted more issues before they arose and given tighter guidelines on working process to make the ride smoother for the mentees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;successes&#34;&gt;Successes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-gislingham-village-website&#34;&gt;The Gislingham village website&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely believe that the resulting website, &lt;a href=&#34;http://gislingham.com/&#34;&gt;gislingham.com&lt;/a&gt;, that Sibylle, Yago and Phil have worked on is a triumph. Its branding, design, structure and underlying code is more than fit for professional web design and development. In fact, in many areas I think it’s exemplary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-type-of-project&#34;&gt;The type of project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to our fantastic client, Mallen Baker, the village community website was a great fit for a mentoring project. Even though the quality of the resulting site was incredibly important, the idea of a not-for-profit community site feels less high-pressure compared to a money-making corporate site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had challenges in the best way to display the unique content it already contained, and was going to contain in the future. It also had emphasis on ease of use for less tech-savvy users. This meant continually checking and ensuring ease of use for all potential users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mixed-disciplines&#34;&gt;Mixed disciplines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I split, and may have unevenly weighted, the roles within the project, the whole team had a good idea of what was required, assisted each other in key decisions and could take over from each other when required to do so. This was a testament to the varied skills of the mentees and their flexibility, as well as being a successful element of my hybrid ideology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;great-teamwork&#34;&gt;Great teamwork&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were times where enviable teamwork took place. Smooth communication, smart analysis and decision-making, and effective collaboration. This made me particularly proud (though it was nothing to do with me!) As someone who often works in teams, but rarely as closely, the fact the team managed to establish these close bonds in such a short time was impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;guidelines-for-better-mentoring&#34;&gt;Guidelines for better mentoring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my first go at mentoring a web project and I knew it was unlikely to be perfect. I was unprepared for how much it would challenge me, my working processes, and my abilities (or lack thereof) as a leader.&amp;nbsp;I wasn’t great, and I really appreciate the risk Sibylle, Yago and Phil took in joining me on this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are guidelines to help me do better next time, I hope they might be helpful to anyone else looking to mentor other people who are new to the industry or client work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### Guidelines for a better business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a couple of things I learnt from the project (and the mentees) that I think could improve my business in the long term. Both of these involve an evolution of my current contract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t just stop at copyright: specify the exact licenses (Creative Commons, MIT, GNU etc) and whether these are retained by you or the client. I already do the latter but have previously failed to research the former. Doing this should result in a clearer contract with more detailed and universally-understood terms without having to add much more text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a contract with a payment schedule of 50% up front and 50% on launch, specify exactly what will prompt the final invoice. I haven’t had this structure in my contracts for a while but when I did my contract was vague at best, leaving me to bill when I felt it was the “right time.” This can lead to confusion and uncertainty on both sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### One-to-one mentoring probably works better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a team, and the equal division of labour sounds like it might make for a smooth project, there are many issues brought about by many people learning to work together for the first time. If anything, I’d now recommend using &lt;a href=&#34;http://ryanhavoctaylor.com/business/traditional-apprenticeships-fall-down-for-the-web/&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Traditional Apprenticeships fall down for the web…by Ryan Taylor&#34;&gt;an apprenticeship model&lt;/a&gt;. Make yourself, the mentor, the other team member, so you can lead by example. Allow the mentee to take responsibility by doing, but also let them learn by seeing more closely how it’s done by a professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### Face-to-face is probably better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really is too easy to forget the value of face-to-face interaction when working with other people remotely. I believe that for a truly useful mentoring experience on both sides, frequent face-to-face, or at least voice-to-voice meetings are invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### Ensure the roles are clear from the beginning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t be as easy as assigning “you can do the visual design” to a mentee, sitting back and expecting them to know the rest. The whole point of the project is to provide guidance and so you should be pro-active in suggesting the responsibilities and tasks associated with that role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### Set out standards for client communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, you cannot expect the mentees to know the best way to communicate with clients when they are there to learn from you. Tell them what you’ve found to be most effective and set guidelines and milestones for the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### Allow more time than you think is necessary, and multiply that by 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re used to working fulltime on projects and your estimates for project duration will probably be based on your experience of similar projects. Remember that your mentee is learning on the job, so multiply by two again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been so lucky to work with such passionate and hard-working people. I can’t recommend mentoring enough to others more experienced in client work. Much like people say of teaching or speaking, it really does compound the knowledge you already have, and makes you realise more about yourself than you’d think possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been far too long since I wrote about the mentoring project. I’ve been incredibly busy and really needed to dedicate more time to make it a success (more about that in another post!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time I wrote about the project, we had just started to get the contract sorted. I use an evolved version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/contract-killer/&#34;&gt;Andy Clarke’s Contract Killer&lt;/a&gt; for my client projects. Over the last four years I’ve amended it, and added in extra chunks, to prevent myself from repeating the same mistakes on multiple projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reused this contract again for this project, adding in some extra text about my responsibility as a mentor to the client and mentees. We then decided, prompted by the client’s desire to potentially share the code with other community projects, and Yago’s knowledge of &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/&#34;&gt;Creative Commons licenses&lt;/a&gt;, to license the code under the &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/&#34;&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;licensing-code&#34;&gt;Licensing code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting and important part of the contract, and merits discussion. Previously I had always used the Contract Killer’s lines about licensing where the client has all the rights to the graphics/design elements, whereas the developer has the rights to the code and licenses it to the client for one use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This always seemed to make sense to me before, it restricts the client from rehashing your code for a different project, or even reselling it to others. But code is not a static one-off document. A website, and subsequently its code, is a living document which is usually frequently updated, fixed and improved upon. How does this then work with a one-use license? Are we then telling clients that if they need any code to be changed, they must re-hire us for the job? This wouldn’t work for most client-developer relationships. As an industry, we seem to have mostly moved to a model where we give clients the tools and knowledge to keep their own sites updated. Maintenance contracts are a thing of the past for all but the most complex systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yago found the perfect license for our particular case, where we wanted to allow the client to share the work on a not-for-profit basis, but I do urge you to &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/choose/&#34; title=&#34;choose a Creative Commons license&#34;&gt;look into the correct license which &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; makes it clear what the client is and isn’t allowed to do&lt;/a&gt;. And the wonderful thing about Creative Commons is that they write the licenses in plain English. This means the licenses work with the Contract Killer, and also makes it easy to find the best license for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-all-takes-time&#34;&gt;It all takes time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorting out the contract took a lot more time than I’d have liked. When so many parties need to sign a contract, it can take a lot of to-ing and fro-ing before it’s agreed upon. Add in email-based communication and people working on the project part-time, and it took us a good couple of weeks to get it all ironed out. Far too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://rightsignature.com/&#34;&gt;Right Signature&lt;/a&gt; to get documents signed online, and I was jumping into it too quickly. It’s fairly quick to email a PDF (or even better, pasted text) of the contract for all the signers glance over before they need to sign. As fantastic as &lt;a href=&#34;https://rightsignature.com/features&#34; title=&#34;features of Right Signature&#34;&gt;Right Signature’s sequential signers option&lt;/a&gt; is, it’s a complete pain if you get to the last person to sign the contract and they need to make an amendment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-the-contract&#34;&gt;After the contract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the contract was signed, having roles within the project actually become useful. Whilst I expected Yago, Sibylle and Phil to work as hybrids, collaborating on design and development, their responsibilities to lead on front-end development, content and WordPress and design (respectively) meant each could be responsible for planning more in-depth requirements for that area. These requirements took a while to nail down but provided a structure to work from, and gave each mentee a better idea of what the others were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/aside&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;comment-entry&#34;&gt;
        When it comes to licenses for code, I see nothing wrong with the old standards: the GNU General Public License, and the GNU Lesser GPL. Particularly when working with WordPress, where plugin and theme code is meant to be GPL compatible, using the GPL just makes sense. Yes, it does mean that the client could turn around and re-use, re-sell or whatever, the code. But considering that your name should be clearly identified anyway (in the license block at the top of each file), it will be obvious who to turn to to fix any issues. 

Moreover, by using a license that permits re-use, modification, etc., you are clearly saying, “I am not locking you in to my services, if you’re not happy, you can go else where with no problem; I’ll try and keep you happy”. And I think that’s valuable in and of itself.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Learning to speak</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/learning-to-speak/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Just over a year ago, I was in a country I’d never visited, about to give two talks I’d never given before to two large, paying audiences in the space of three days at &lt;a href=&#34;http://futureinsightslive.com/las-vegas-2012/&#34;&gt;Future Insights Live&lt;/a&gt;. I had only given a couple of talks to small audiences before. It was one of the scariest things I’d ever done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-helping-hand&#34;&gt;A helping hand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://aralbalkan.com&#34;&gt;Aral Balkan&lt;/a&gt; speak a few times before. His talk at &lt;a href=&#34;http://futureofwebdesign.com/london-2011/&#34;&gt;Future Of Web Design&lt;/a&gt; had blown me away. I recommended him to my friends who organising &lt;a href=&#34;http://thebigm.mobi/&#34;&gt;The Big M&lt;/a&gt; as a must-have speaker. On the first of the five days at Future Insights, Aral kindly offered to go through my talks with me. In just one hour, I had learned so much, and my confidence increased hugely. My talk the next day went down really well. We repeated the process the following day, my next talk was also a success. I’d done it, I started getting more and more speaking offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-just-me&#34;&gt;Not just me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over this last year I’ve learned I’m not so special. In fact, I’ve seen and heard about Aral giving speaker training to many people. Some have gone over their talks a few times, some have had last-minute reassurances. Everyone has come out happier and more confident with their talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lots-to-learn&#34;&gt;Lots to learn&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things I’ve learned from Aral haven’t just been “how to give a talk”. There were so many facets I’d never even considered before. How do I walk on the stage? How do I finish my talk? How do I set up the stage? How do I interact with the audience afterwards without just being awkward?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s never about over-thinking my talk, or treating my talk like I’m giving a world-class performance. It’s about being prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-re-all-different-speakers&#34;&gt;We’re all different speakers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aral never tried to make me speak like him. He’s naturally very funny on stage, his jokes have audiences roaring. I’m not like that. I can never remember the punchline and have a unique talent for making jokes really uncomfortable. Aral taught me how to improve my own style, working on basic principles that apply to everyone, and how to fight awful bouts of nerves and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-masterclass-you-shouldn-t-miss&#34;&gt;The masterclass you shouldn’t miss&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aral didn’t ask me to write this post. If he did, I would’ve said no, I’m contrary like that… I wanted to tell you about &lt;a href=&#34;http://slideandstage.com&#34;&gt;the masterclass Aral is holding in June&lt;/a&gt;, where you can benefit from all the things he’s taught me, but in the space of one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people ask my advice on speaking, and honestly, I just pass on what Aral’s taught me. The best piece of advice &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; can give you is to &lt;a href=&#34;http://slideandstage.com&#34;&gt;take this masterclass&lt;/a&gt;. It’s very affordable (I say this as a wary freelancer!) And I promise it will make a huge difference to your talks.&lt;/p&gt;

        I did my first mini speaking gig at Untangle the Web and even though I had a lot of very nice comments, me, myself thought it was a train wreck. I think the main problem was I wasn’t myself and probably came across more like a robot in some stages. It was a small talk about why people that are using CSS &lt;b&gt;should&lt;/b&gt; use Sass and how easy it was to get started.

Afterwards I realised I didn’t even explain what Sass stood for :/ It was one of those talks :P

If I could I would most definitely go to Aral’s workshop. I’ll never forget seeing him for the first time at FOWD. His talk was totally engrossing and very informative.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous posts, I mentioned that I was going to explain the details of the project later on. This was because I didn’t want to get bogged down by the details of the brief while I was focusing on finding the right team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’ve got our team together, I can elaborate on our client and the brief. I was very lucky to be contacted by the lovely &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mallenbaker.net/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&#34;&gt;Mallen Baker&lt;/a&gt;, who had a great project in mind and was willing to give me, and the mentees I chose, a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gislingham-village-website&#34;&gt;Gislingham village website&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gislingham is a rural village in Suffolk which has a thriving community with a number of local organisations and businesses. The village website is to be revamped to be able to provide an excellent online support to that community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://gislingham.com&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&#34;&gt;http://gislingham.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website is an old site, using now outdated development techniques (tables!) created by Mallen around ten years ago. Whilst the site has been maintained and updated, it’s in need of a redesign to help it better serve the local community. We are at two distinct advantages here. The existing website means that we can learn from what does and doesn’t work on the existing site. Also, having a client who works in the web industry gives us the advantage that we won’t have to teach the client about the web as we work on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-first-client-meeting&#34;&gt;Our first client meeting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mallen was keen to meet Phil, Yago and Sibylle, and it was a good opportunity to kick the project off. We met last Friday in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparation for our first meeting, the mentees dissected the brief and assembled a list of questions for the client. They each made their own lists and then collated these together in a master list which covered a huge range of detail and depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yago, Sibylle and Phil explored tools and file formats that everybody could use together without causing compatibility issues, wrote a very thorough content inventory and started looking at personas based on the brief and existing users, and researched project management systems at length to find one that was best suited to us, settling on Basecamp. This meant that we had somewhere to keep our discussions as all the email was becoming unruly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-meeting&#34;&gt;The meeting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to stay out the way in the meeting. All of the preparation and research that the mentees had done assured me that they were very capable running the meeting. I tried to only jump in when I thought something might be overlooked (rarely) and to assure them the role I would take for the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mallen started by explaining more background on the project and what he was looking for in the new site. This informal start already answered a lot of the questions that the mentees had prepared and helped us get to know Mallen better. Then the mentees ran through the list of questions they had, asking any other questions they came up with as they thought of them. This was exactly what I was hoping would happen. Everybody was comfortable enough to ask questions at any point but we didn’t all end up speaking over each other either!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;money&#34;&gt;Money&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end, I went over how I thought the project should be run, and we talked about money. I’ve been getting better at discussing money with clients, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&#34;&gt;listening to Andy and Anna on Unfinished Business&lt;/a&gt; has given me more confidence and reassurance that this is the best way to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want the project to be run as much as possible like I would run a client project myself. This means taking payment in stages, not just in one lump sum. Over the last six months I’ve successfully moved my clients to a structure where I bill 50% of the estimated project as a deposit/retainer, then bill every first and third Thursday of the month (pretty much every two weeks) to ensure a sensible cash flow and that nobody has to wait for, or pay, enormous invoices at the end of a long project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mimicking this process, we decided that, as we’re looking at a nominal payment of £500, breaking it into less than two stages would become a little too much of an admin nightmare. I will have to take the payment, and then pass it on to each mentee. If this got down to sending £10 payments around, it would be more hassle than it was worth. So we decided on a 50% up front and 50% on completion (the details of which will be ironed out in the contract).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-next-steps&#34;&gt;The next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we kick off the project, the mentees are going to assemble a proposal/estimate where they break down what needs doing and how long each task should take. This will help us plan how best to run the project and work out if our deadline is realistic. My next step is sorting out a contract for all of us to sign to make sure we understand our roles and responsibilities over the next couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;

        I really love this project you’re doing. It’s a great idea and can provide some great experience for those you selected. It’s great of you to share and help them. Mentoring can be invaluable. 

I’m really interested to follow along and see how it plays out.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I had a lovely chat with El for her &lt;a href=&#34;http://nothingtodisplay.co.uk/2013/03/02/nothing-to-display-podcast-no-3-the-web-freelance-life-mentoring-with-laura-kalbag/&#34;&gt;Nothing To Display podcast&lt;/a&gt;. We talked about technology and how people get started with technology, accessibility, mentoring and dystopian futures! It was a real treat.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mentoring a project: finding the right people</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/mentoring-a-project-finding-the-right-people/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got a project! I’ll elaborate on the details of the project in a future post, but the importance of having a project was that it’s allowed me to choose the designers/developers who could get something out of being &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentee&#34;&gt;mentees&lt;/a&gt;. I didn’t want to do this before securing the right project as I needed to know what I was looking for in a mentee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-the-right-mentee-for-the-job&#34;&gt;Finding the right mentee for the job&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever had to make. After my idea &lt;a href=&#34;http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/thoughts-on-mentoring&#34;&gt;gained significant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz/4&#34;&gt;(kind) exposure&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve also felt the pressure to make sure I get it right. What’s made it even harder is that every designer/developer that sent me an email about the project was sweet, enthusiastic and incredibly willing. I had thirty-two candidates and no idea how best to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;shortlisting&#34;&gt;Shortlisting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-on&#34;&gt;Early on&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;payment&#34;&gt;Payment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cut down into short list whilst I was looking into the original project idea. I knew that it wouldn’t be a high-paying project; I wanted the majority of the value to be in the learning experience, and I made that clear in my first email to everyone who had contacted me. This meant a couple of candidates who were already serious freelancers, looking for a well-paid project, withdrew themselves. It’s always good to talk money up front! A few people didn’t reply at all, and that was fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-stage&#34;&gt;First stage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;team-work&#34;&gt;Team work&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I needed to work out the best way to eventually reduce my list of now thirteen to just a few. I was wary that nobody could take on a low-paying project, dedicate a huge amount of time to it and deliver great results; I asked which candidates were willing to work in small teams. As I knew all the candidates already had other work or studies, I thought it unrealistic to expect one person to do all the work. It would also require a hybrid designer-developer who was capable in front-end and back-end development. Now these people are rare in the industry, and would be almost impossible to find in anyone just starting out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made my short list even shorter. There were a few people who would prefer to work solo and so this project wouldn’t be the right match for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;specialism&#34;&gt;Specialism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this first stage I also asked whether the candidates preferred to work in design, front-end development, back-end development, or a combination of two or three skill areas. I was concerned I might end up with a surplus of one skill area, but actually it was a fairly even spread of all three, with most expressing interest in at least two areas. Hoorah for hybrids!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;enthusiasm-vs-talent&#34;&gt;Enthusiasm vs talent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I was keen to emphasise at this point was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;interest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in skill areas, not experience and not ability. If I’m asking to mentor people who are starting out in the industry, I can’t possibly expect them to have a wealth of experience in all the relevant areas. And those areas that they do have experience in may not be those they enjoy. Likewise, I can’t expect anyone to be fully proficient in their skill of choice. I can always advise them the best place to learn relevant new knowledge. All I need is for them to know the basics and &lt;strong&gt;really want&lt;/strong&gt; to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;favourite-work&#34;&gt;Favourite work&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly typical interview-style question. You could ask someone what their “best” piece of work was, and you may get their favourite piece of work, but you’re equally likely to get their most technically-proficient piece of work, or that which they think is most impressive, even if they hated the project and don’t like the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I asked for the candidate’s favourite project and why it was their favourite. I think this got me more of an insight into what they really cared about, and what holds the most value for them in a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;too-early-for-this-information&#34;&gt;Too early for this information&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst it was good to know I had an even coverage of skill areas at this stage, and what their favourite project was, it was too soon to use this information. Without knowing the project we were going to work on, how was I to judge how well the project would suit them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;second-stage&#34;&gt;Second stage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I knew what the project was going to be, there was more purpose in my questions. I sent another email to the remaining eight candidates. At this point I became sure that I was looking for three mentees to work as a team. I thought that this wouldn’t be too many people to make communication difficult, but enough to cope with the project in a way that would give them time to enjoy what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;still-interested&#34;&gt;Still interested?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked again if they were still interested. I wanted to make sure nobody felt like they’d committed to the project just through expressing their interest over a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;wordpress-experience&#34;&gt;WordPress experience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our project brief states that the website needs to be based on WordPress. Without going too much into the project or client (yet!) I knew that this was an appropriate solution for the project, so I really needed to find at least one candidate with some WordPress experience to lead that part of the development. Everybody showed willingness to learn even if they didn’t have any experience (love them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;blogging-the-process&#34;&gt;Blogging the process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After realising that a lot of people were talking about the project on Twitter, and I’d promised to blog about it, I realised that I’d have to make sure that any mentees were happy with me doing this, and trusted me to do the right thing. So, lastly I asked if they were happy with me writing about them. I emphasised that this wasn’t really about me picking the right match, I was just wondering how much to blog and how much to mention them. Obviously I would never post anything that just pointed out flaws in somebody’s work, but if we learn from our mistakes through constructive criticism, I think that’s a positive experience that we can collectively share and use to help other people learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody was happy with me blogging; I was starting to worry as their supportiveness was making it harder to choose!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;third-stage&#34;&gt;Third stage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I was desperately trying to work out the best ways to narrow down the list. I decided that it would be most sensible to ask what everybody’s weekly availability was, and which timezones/locations they were based in. I was fully expecting remote working, but it was important that the mentees were able to work together in a team and communicate easily. This helped me find three people whose availability suited each other, and whose skills complemented each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-final-decision&#34;&gt;The final decision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I didn’t anticipate was deciding that a couple of candidates were over-qualified for working in these teams. Looking at their experience, I was concerned that if they worked in a team, they would end up picking up too much of the slack because they had a significantly broader knowledge in web design and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dream-team&#34;&gt;The dream team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got my team down to the following three:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sibweber&#34;&gt;Sibylle&lt;/a&gt; –; Lead on WordPress and Content Strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/yagohimself&#34;&gt;Yago&lt;/a&gt; –; Lead on Front-end Development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/philippickering&#34;&gt;Phil&lt;/a&gt; –; Lead on Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit to team work would be that roles needn’t be fixed,  I expect the team to work together as closely as possible. Still, I thought I’d recommend that each mentee has their area to lead so they know how valuable they are to the project’s success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;onwards&#34;&gt;Onwards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we will have our first client meeting and get started on the project. I’ll have another update then.&lt;/p&gt;

thanks for this write-up –; nice to read about how you made your decision, bet it wasn’t an easy task :) Curious to follow this project now and see how it will work out—good luck to you all :)&lt;/p&gt;
*PS: from my perspective as their tutor, I am so very happy that your final selection included Yago and Sibylle ~ they’re both lovely as well as talented and will contribute some great work ;)*

        I think this is a really wonderful thing that you are doing, Laura. In order to make the future of the Web better, we need to start with the people. One of my goals for this year is to find a mentor as well. I realize that I have many areas that I need to improve, but I also believe I have a lot to offer to the right team somewhere. 

I look forward to seeing how your mentees progress over the coming weeks and months. Keep making the web a better place. :)
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Laura, 

This is such an inspiring thing to do, made me consider how I might go about mentoring more people and helping them build skills. Looking forward to seeing this work and how we can all help usher in new designers and developers onto the web.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        I was disappointed not to be picked for this, but I’d like to wish you the best of luck for the project! 

Can’t wait to see how it turns out, it’s such a nice thing to do for folks.

      <title>Mentoring a project: the right project</title>

&lt;p&gt;This post is an update on &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/mentoring-a-project-the-idea/&#34; title=&#34;Mentoring a project: The idea&#34;&gt;my mentoring project idea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-the-right-project&#34;&gt;Finding the right project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you follow me on Twitter, you might have seen that I’m now looking for a different project to work on. Whilst the previous project I had in mind would have been great fun, the client had a very tight deadline. I didn’t want to push that pressure on to students and freelancers who are likely to have other work they need to do in order to pass their studies or pay the bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s that typical situation where the client can have it two of three ways “fast, cheap, good quality.” Working on a project that doesn’t allow time for good quality isn’t going to help anyone get worthwhile experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-would-be-the-right-project&#34;&gt;What would be the right project?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to think about what would make the ideal project in this kind of situation. This is what I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 13px;&#34;&gt;A website project where the end goal would be to launch the site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new website or a complete redesign, so new ideas can be generated and developed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A project where every element (design, development, hosting) is entirely in the freelancer’s hands, so they can get a wide experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A project with one or two stakeholders (clients) so that communication is fairly straight-forward (but still of utmost importance!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A modest budget. I want everyone to gain something, so there may not be a huge budget for the project, but I want there to be &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; budget. Of course, the experience is supposed to be the valuable part of this project, but I wouldn’t work for free so I wouldn’t encourage anyone else to do it either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-you-have-a-project-that-we-could-use&#34;&gt;Do you have a project that we could use?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means I’m now looking for a more suitable project. If you’re in need of a small(ish) website, and don’t have the budget for a fulltime professional web designer or developer, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/contact-me/&#34; title=&#34;Contact Me&#34;&gt;get in touch with me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-comments&#34;&gt;2 comments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol class=&#34;commentlist&#34;&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Mentoring a project: the idea</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/mentoring-a-project-the-idea/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, a potential project turned up in my inbox. An old school friend wants a website, needs it soon and doesn’t have a huge budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;me-and-freelancing&#34;&gt;Me and freelancing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m lucky, I get offered a lot of projects, and usually I don’t have any availability for a few months. Little projects like this generally can’t pay the bills for me. It’s a lot of time (particularly admin) for a fairly small return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a very small list of trusted designers that I’ll happily pass these projects. The thing is, when I do this, it’s a risk for me too. If I recommend someone who turns out to be unreliable, it makes me look bad too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-inspiration&#34;&gt;The inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After listening to &lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz/&#34;&gt;Unfinished Business&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://unfinished.bz/#presenters&#34;&gt;Anna Debenham and Andy Clarke&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve been inspired to be more open about how I work. I’ve never been one to keep secrets, I’m always happy to discuss my rates and how I work with anyone, but I’ve never actively shared this information. And after talking to loads of students recently, I’ve realised that one of the hardest things, after landing a project in the first place, is knowing how to run a project and talk to clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-idea&#34;&gt;The idea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These thoughts and this project collided in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to help “de-mystify” these elements of freelancing. I wouldn’t call myself an expert, I’m not sure many people could. But after around four years of freelancing, I feel like I am &lt;em&gt;successful&lt;/em&gt;; I make enough money to support myself, living and working by myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that the transition from student to freelancer is particularly hard, and so I’m looking for students/graduates/new freelancers to work on this project. Here’s the tweet that I sent out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/laurakalbag/status/296305016954834944&#34;&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;
I’ve already had more than twenty replies, my next goal is to make sure I find one or two people who can gain as much as possible from this project. If you’re interested, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/contact-me/&#34; title=&#34;Contact Me&#34;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll hopefully be sending out an email to everyone who’s interested later on today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping to blog the process as much as possible, so other people can share in our experience. My next post will cover how I’m going to try to find a good match to work on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-comments&#34;&gt;8 comments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol class=&#34;commentlist&#34;&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Laura :)

just wanted to repeat that I think this is such a brilliant idea, one which all parties will benefit from for sure :)

Working with real clients is something that teaches so much, having a mentor / expert at hand to run to for help and advise is invaluable. As a student or newcomer to the field, it is often scary—though it does not need to be.

This is one of the reasons why I get my students to work with a [ real client project ](http://webeyedea.info/wp/real-client-sites/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow) during my course. Tends to be quite time-consuming for me, to manage it all (number of students = number of clients)—but… **it is really worth it**: happy, grateful clients &amp;amp; happy, more informed newbies &amp;amp; one happy tutor :-)&lt;/p&gt;
Your idea of doing this is fabulous –; hope you will find a good match :) and really hope this will inspire more web peeps to follow suit :)
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        This is a great idea Laura. I’ve had a couple of &lt;i&gt;“those”&lt;/i&gt; kind of job requests recently and this seems a much more constructive approach than taking on the job directly and potentially spoiling a friendship :) 

I tend to forget how hard-won my 10 years of accumulated web knowledge has been and how valuable it could be to new designers &amp;amp; developers.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        This is such a great idea, don’t know of many others who’ve done something like this but it sounds like it’d be really helpful to someone trying to get experience.
    &lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following my &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/learning-design/&#34; title=&#34;Learning Design&#34;&gt;learning design post&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve started a little project called “new to design.” At the moment it just consists of &lt;a href=&#34;https://pinboard.in/u:laurakalbag/t:learn-design/&#34;&gt;a learn-design tag on my Pinboard bookmarks&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/newtodesign&#34;&gt;Twitter account @newtodesign &lt;/a&gt;so that I can share useful design resources (especially for those new to design.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, I hope it can be useful in other ways. Any suggestions or anything you want to see? &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/contact-me/&#34; title=&#34;Contact Me&#34;&gt;You know how to get in touch…&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Learning Design</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/learning-design/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Every now and again someone will email me asking how they should go about learning design. After reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://aralbalkan.com/notes/design-is-not-veneer/&#34;&gt;Aral Balkan’s fantastic post&lt;/a&gt; on how design is not veneer, a few developers also expressed frustration at there not being many resources telling you how to get started with design. So I thought I’d post a few of my favourite links, books and ways of approaching design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, read &lt;a href=&#34;http://aralbalkan.com/notes/design-is-not-veneer/&#34;&gt;Aral’s post&lt;/a&gt;. It might seem intimidating. Aral emphasises the importance of considering every tiny design decision you make. There’s no easy-in. But really there’s no easy-in to doing anything well. Development might appear to be something with a low barrier to entry, but in order to do development with web standards, or to any level of efficiency, you need to take the time to learn the best techniques and working processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering every tiny design decision might also make design seem like a much more arduous process than it needs to be. In truth, if you are considering your users, their experience, and your overall design vision in the back of your mind, every decision you make whilst designing will be considered. It can feel somewhat subconscious at times. If you have the ‘feeling’ that your choice of typography suits the project, then chances are, if you analyse the cognitive and emotional impact on the user, you’ll find your subconscious actually made those decisions for a reason. Design isn’t instinct. This ‘instinct’ is really something that we’ve built up from the experience of millions of different design decisions, and evaluating their success and failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning-how-to-design&#34;&gt;Learning &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design is a pretty tricky thing to just ‘learn’; it doesn’t happen overnight. Following a tutorial on how to create a photo-realistic SLR camera in Photoshop is about as useful as following a tutorial on how to create an SLR camera in CSS; it teaches you how to use the tools but not about why you’d want to use an SLR camera illustration in your design. The best thing is to try as many different design tasks as possible to test yourself and gain experience on what does and doesn’t work. I also find looking at other people’s design work and considering its effectiveness really helps develop an understanding of design principles in relation to your own personal taste. This is what a lot of art and design education is built around; interpreting and understanding the work of other people. Blog posts where people tell you about their inspiration and how they designed their sites are the best sources for this kind of learning as you get real insight into the decisions of the designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opposite of this are sites that showcase trends, ‘beautiful’ websites or lists of a particular type of site as ‘inspiration.’ These tend to be examples of what are very aesthetically-pleasing designs, but not necessarily successful designs in terms of a good user experience. Of course convention can be a trend of sorts. If one designer establishes a really easy-to-use type of navigation, then it’s inevitable that those working on similar projects may use that standard as a basis for their own navigation, but only &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt; projects. It’s so easy to mimic a lovely visual aesthetic to make your project look good, but you really need to consider if that’s an &lt;em&gt;appropriate&lt;/em&gt; aesthetic style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;blogs&#34;&gt;Blogs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog-wise, I prefer the more ideasy and critical thinking blogs, as I find ‘how to design xyz’ is never terribly useful unless you’re working on an identical project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-list-apart-design-category-http-www-alistapart-com-topics-design&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alistapart.com/topics/design/&#34;&gt;A List Apart design category&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few magazine sites curate design content so well. It’s all too easy to fall into posts that are just lists of ‘inspiration.’ A List Apart is one of the most tightly-curated and edited magazines around, and their design articles are always worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;paul-robert-lloyd-http-www-paulrobertlloyd-com-journal&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paulrobertlloyd.com/journal/&#34;&gt;Paul Robert Lloyd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to learn more about design thinking, especially a focus on how responsiveness fits into design, Paul Robert Lloyd’s posts are must-reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;usabilitypost-http-www-usabilitypost-com&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usabilitypost.com/&#34;&gt;UsabilityPost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very insightful blog focused on usability, often discussing design in terms of successful user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;sidebar-io-http-sidebar-io&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://sidebar.io/&#34;&gt;Sidebar.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidebar.io is crowd-sourced by a select group, so has a slightly curated more zeitgeist-y feel to it. The links aren’t always long-form articles on design, but if there’s a good post going around, they’ll pick up on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;mark-boulton-http-www-markboulton-co-uk-journal&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal&#34;&gt;Mark Boulton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark has always been talking about more traditional design theory as a part of web design, and his approach has always inspired me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;people&#34;&gt;People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is a great way to keep up with good designers. I find these snippets of insight can often provide bite-size inspiration when I really need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;books&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m always disappointed that there aren’t more design theory books with a focus on web design. The few I’ve found are here, but also books on usability and graphic design where you can combine the knowledge to create a great design background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-practical-guide-to-designing-the-invisible-by-robert-mills-http-www-fivesimplesteps-com-products-a-practical-guide-to-designing-the-invisible&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/a-practical-guide-to-designing-the-invisible&#34;&gt;A Practical Guide to Designing the Invisible by Robert Mills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding design as a language, and how design is more than just the visual decoration. &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/a-practical-guide-to-designing-the-invisible/&#34; title=&#34;A Practical Guide to Designing the invisible&#34;&gt;I’ve reviewed Rob’s book in more depth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-practical-guide-to-designing-for-the-web-by-mark-boulton-http-www-fivesimplesteps-com-products-a-practical-guide-to-designing-for-the-web&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/a-practical-guide-to-designing-for-the-web&#34;&gt;A Practical Guide to Designing for the Web by Mark Boulton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great grounding in many of the different areas of design theory in relation to the web. I’m very eagerly awaiting Mark’s next book on grid theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;ordering-disorder-grid-principles-for-web-design-by-khoi-vinh-http-grids-subtraction-com&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://grids.subtraction.com/&#34;&gt;Ordering Disorder: Grid Principles for Web Design by Khoi Vinh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-dating responsive design, but still a very valuable book for learning about applying grids to web design in a practical way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-elements-of-user-experience-by-jesse-james-garrett-http-www-jjg-net-elements&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jjg.net/elements/&#34;&gt;The Elements of User Experience by Jesse James Garrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An oldie but a goodie. These founding principles really molded the way I view design for the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;designing-for-emotion-by-aarron-walter-http-www-abookapart-com-products-designing-for-emotion&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion&#34;&gt;Designing for Emotion by Aarron Walter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering not just the user experience, but the user emotions. A quick but brilliant read which &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/designing-for-emotion/&#34; title=&#34;Designing For Emotion&#34;&gt;I’ve reviewed in more depth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;edit-how-could-i-forget-this-first-time-round-elements-of-typographic-style-by-robert-bringhurst-http-www-amazon-co-uk-elements-typographic-style-robert-bringhurst-dp-0881792063&#34;&gt;[Edit: How could I forget this first time round?!] &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063&#34;&gt;Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An incredibly in-depth guide to typography, giving you all the basic principles you need and more.[/edit]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;edit-2-8faces-magazine-http-8faces-com&#34;&gt;[Edit 2:] &lt;a href=&#34;http://8faces.com/&#34;&gt;8faces Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not quite a book, but a beautiful typography magazine with new releases a few times a year. 8faces introduces you to great quality typefaces and provides plenty of insight into design with its feature interviews.[/edit]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-ll-try-to-keep-them-coming&#34;&gt;I’ll try to keep them coming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources on learning design aren’t necessarily those I keep a lookout for, but I’m going to make a conscious effort to do so from now on. I’ll &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/laurakalbag&#34;&gt;post on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and maybe do a round-up post later on, so let me know if you know of any good resources I should check out.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hi Laura, Love what you’re doing here. I myself am a college student and I created [Student Guide Web Design](http://www.studentguidewebdesign.com&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow) simply out of frustration with the material I was being presented during my design education. I love helping others because it’s a great way for me to learn myself, but also helps others out who are also trying to overcome the same challenges (because I was there at one point!).

Cheers from Canada :)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>We read with our own contexts</title>
      <link>https://laurakalbag.com/we-read-with-our-own-contexts/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Oh Twitter. Yesterday was another day where I accidentally incited another riot with a poorly-worded tweet. Nobody is perfect, but it’s starting to happen with alarming frequency, and I wanted to understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I keep doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-ever-present-ego&#34;&gt;The ever-present ego&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We read everything through our own ego filter. It’s how we apply new knowledge to our own situations. Whenever we read a tweet, blog post, article, book, watch a TV show, a film, a play, we take in what we’re reading and hearing and apply it to ourselves. How does this affect me? What do I think of this? Does this mean that what I do is right or what I do is wrong? It’s not that we’re entirely intentionally selfish, it’s just how we comprehend the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, if we’re working on the web, we tend to filter what we read through our own specialisms. If an article doesn’t mention what we think is incredibly important, we deride it as thoughtless. If a tweet doesn’t include that exception that we feel makes all the difference, we jump around, compulsively feeling the need to add our own opinions or defend our own positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;forgetting-over-and-over&#34;&gt;Forgetting over and over&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow we manage to forget over and over what we’re constantly saying to each other: 140 characters is not enough for context. A blog post or article is just one facet of a topic, or a facet of a facet of a fragment of a subject. To always include every detail would take forever (and would make for a dull read) and, you know what, &lt;strong&gt;you don’t have to always be right&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t introduce my blog posts saying “I am speaking from a position of authority here…” Because that would be a lie. In fact, I often do the opposite, but it’s still not necessary. Who is anyone to decide what is ‘right’ and what is ‘wrong’? All we can advise are the widely-accepted standards, and even those won’t be right forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One person’s point of view is exactly that. The wonder of the web is that we can put our ideas out there and others can help us refine them. We have creative and journeying discussions. We make progress. A lot can be learned and shared from something written about a controversial subject. If we don’t discuss these subjects, how do we expect people to learn? Even if we’re sure we’re “right,” how better can we help others to see our points of view? I value every comment left on my blog. If you look back through my posts, almost every one has a comment that has taught me something new, even if it’s just how other people approach things from a different angle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;criticism-comes-in-two-forms&#34;&gt;Criticism comes in two forms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we disagree with something that someone else has written, we must take the most care to express ourselves possible. Here I’m providing myself as an example of what not to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/laurakalbag/status/280613649289211904&#34;&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;we-write-with-our-own-contexts-too&#34;&gt;We write with our own contexts too&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you’ve never read another one of my tweets, that does come across as a rather unpleasant criticism of the author, 24ways and Bootstrap. And for that I’m really sorry and I’ve been regretting it ever since. Enveloped in my ego, I wrote it as if all my previous tweets about Bootstrap (from days and weeks and months ago, not prior to that tweet) were context. Not only does that assume that people will read all my tweets, but also that they’d remember them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must remember that we write with our contexts shut up in our own heads, and we should really provide them where possible. Linking to something that you’ve written on that topic, or just writing with a little more consideration, you can prevent yourself coming across as unkind when you really didn’t mean to appear that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went on to write twelve follow-up tweets. Each trying to clarify, yet back-pedalling, on the last. And that doesn’t even include the multitude of @replies. I just made a big mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;constructive-criticism-is-aware-of-context&#34;&gt;Constructive criticism is aware of context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constructive criticism is when you may be negative about something, but your criticism explains &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you think something isn’t right, and what could be done to resolve it. You don’t have to have the solutions to everything in order to criticise, but it shows respect to show that your opinion is relevant and considered rather than just a knee-jerk reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;if-it-s-not-constructive-then-it-s-the-other-thing&#34;&gt;If it’s not constructive, then it’s the other thing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your criticism isn’t constructive, then chances are it’ll come across as personal, rude, unkind and possibly even trolling. There’s no wry smiles at the end of tweets, no sarcasm tags, and for all we try with emoticons and expressive animated GIFs, the nuances of face-to-face communication are completely lost on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;play-nice&#34;&gt;Play nice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course criticism is important, if we all just go around telling each other how fantastic we are, we probably wouldn’t try anything new. The web community is a caring and protective place, but we need to make sure we’re contributing in a positive way.&lt;/p&gt;

        The problem yesterday wasn’t your views, whether they were “right” or “wrong”, it was that people have entrenched views. In the web world, as I’m sure it is for many other professions and industries, we find ourselves wedded to techniques and ways of working. When someone questions these things we don’t see it as “Oh, someone doesn’t see this as useful”, we take it to mean “They think it’s a stupid thing to do, and by proxy that I’m stupid for doing it&amp;#8230;but I’m not stupid!”

I think I agreed with the feelings you seemed to project, and discussion around these things is positive. Who knows how many people read about the spat not knowing about bootstrap, or even grid systems, and left with a more balanced view of the pro’s and con’s of how to approach a site?

I think Bootstrap is a crappy way to work, but then I also hate WordPress too, I’d never recommend to people *like me* to use those things&amp;#8230;but that doesn’t mean I don’t regularly recommend them to people that have different backgrounds and requirements. I think maybe that’s what we should all have in our mind when we read something&amp;#8230;

“This isn’t them saying my way, and my beliefs, are wrong&amp;#8230;just that they have a (probably) valid reason why it’s not always suitable”

As long as we try to be respectful, and I hope no-one truly fell out with each other over this (it’s all to easy to think people have got fully annoyed with you when really they just have passionate views!), then these kinds of things are good for the community, because everyone taking part is a slightly different flavour of developer, with a little bit more or less designer in them, or designer with a little bit more or less developer in them. 

It’s this spectrum that can really help us focus on best practices, plural, that apply dependent on our situation and skills.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Hi Laura, recently I’ve seen a couple of designers, Paul Adam Davis, Amber Weinberg and yourself criticising Bootstrap. Coming from a development only backgrounds seems to have left me with whitenoise when it comes to design. Whilst I’m capable of deciding if something looks good or not, I’m unable to design myself, so I rely on design frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation to give me a head start. My blog for example is built on Bootstrap however I paid for a theme via &lt;a href=&#39;https://wrapbootstrap.com/?ref=jbrooksuk&#39; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;WrapBootstrap&lt;/a&gt; to take the standard Bootstrap theme and change it into something beautiful and different. I don’t see the harm in doing that? It’s like you taking a website structure you use on every site and applying custom colours on top. Is that just as bad?

I know we’re coming to a point with bootstrapped websites where a lot of developers are leaving them as the default styles, but many of us work by shipping function over design. With you, perhaps that’s different.

I have a lot of respect for you Laura –; this comment isn’t meant as a stab at yourself or anybody mentioned above. :)
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hey Laura,

Don’t beat yourself up. I think it is also important to realise that everybody is in the same 140char limit as you, and many can (and do) read between the lines. I saw your tweet and wrongly or rightly put 2+2 together, and drew my own conclusion, as I’m sure other people will have. My personal opinion is that frameworks are fantastic for quick prototypes and putting ideas together, but I still prefer to start with a blank template when it comes down to it&amp;#8230;. so yes, those few characters you wrote will always say something different to the reader, wrong or right.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        Fantastic article, Laura, I’ve now re-evaluated how I talk to others online, when to give critique and constructive criticism etc.

I don’t know about you, but one my favourite things in this community is when a dev or designer takes on something I’ve suggested or improves after listening to my criticism, or even respects it and acknowledges it. It’s an absolute delight, and what makes this community a wonderful place; I hope that it will continue to be a place of positivity, and supportiveness.
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Thanks for the interesting and thoughtful post. I think you make some good points about criticism and context. It is not just about our personal context. It is also our culture, our society and so on. People forget or don’t realise that knowledge they take for granted is often not there in other people. 

Also, I think you provide a good example of some of what I don’t like about Twitter.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;For the last few years, I’ve been working with a great team of people on &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/app/bardowl/id492667930?ls=1&amp;amp;amp;mt=8&#34;&gt;our iPhone app&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://bardowl.com&#34;&gt;Bardowl&lt;/a&gt;, an app for streaming unlimited audiobooks for £9.99 a month (think Spotify but for audiobooks.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not been a quick and easy. Getting publishers to come round to the idea, and securing good audiobooks, has been a lengthy process but we’ve been lucky to have people who really know what they’re talking about behind the scenes. Our &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/bookmeister&#34;&gt;CEO, Chris Book&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/neilp33l&#34;&gt;CTO, Neil Chapman&lt;/a&gt;, have bootstrapped the business and have worked incredibly hard, taking a big risk, because they really believe in bringing good audiobooks to the iPhone without massive subscription costs or limited listening choices. They’re the reason I was first interested in being involved, and the reason I’ve stuck at it for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-only-blog-about-it-now&#34;&gt;Why only blog about it now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to wait until there was a version of the app that you’d want to try. Previously, we launched with ‘business books.’ These are wonderful if you’re into management techniques, deals, finances and all these audiobooks that I find, quite honestly, dull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;now-the-catalogue-has-got-so-much-awesome&#34;&gt;Now the catalogue has got so much awesome&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, the catalogue has some serious awesome with biographies and memoirs, childrens books, classic, contemporary and modern fiction, non-fiction, poetry and drama. Roald Dahl’s Revolting Rhymes, Cormac McCarthy’s No Country For Old Men, loads of Dickens and Sherlock Holmes. I really think you’ll like it. Oh yes, and you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/app/bardowl/id492667930?ls=1&amp;amp;amp;mt=8&#34;&gt;try it for free for 7 days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-have-i-done-then&#34;&gt;What have I done then?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am the sole designer. I do all the design; branding, app design and web design/development. It’s really the first product I’ve ever worked with, and I enjoy having something I get to stick with and iterate over time. I’m still not sure if I’d want to do this full time, I really love the variety that comes with client work, but it’s very rewarding feeling like you’re constantly improving one product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;working-for-almost-free&#34;&gt;Working for almost-free&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also work almost solely for a small share (I’ve had a few payments for work when we had some investment.) Since I started time-tracking the project in March 2010, I’ve put 430 hours into the project, around half of that being on the website, which has had three or four full redesigns. This working for almost-free is definitely not something I would do again, which I will elaborate on below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning&#34;&gt;Learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a complete learning experience. It was my first app design work, I created the logo long before I started working professionally as a designer, and I’ve never worked as part of a startup before, in fact I’ve never really worked as part of another company before (as a designer.) Starting before I graduated from university, it’s been a project that has spanned the whole of my freelance/professional career. As I’ve learned new things, I’ve been able to experiment, and put my new knowledge straight into the app and the website. It was my first mobile website design (pre-“Responsive Web Design”,) my first foray into web fonts, my first “Responsive Web Design” and my first experience with CSS pre-processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;designing-and-developing&#34;&gt;Designing and developing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned a huge amount about designing for apps. Unlike designing for the web, where I usually write the markup and sometimes the code, I can’t develop iOS apps. I don’t think this is a good thing, it really emphasises why I think that you must be able to write markup in order to design for the web. Designing for iOS apps, with fairly minimal knowledge of the development process is &lt;em&gt;really hard&lt;/em&gt;. I make a complete pain out of myself, constantly asking &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/kgutteridge&#34;&gt;Kieran&lt;/a&gt; questions about how things work, what’s possible, what’s native, and what would be easiest to create from a development point-of-view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’ve learned loads from Kieran, I still want to know more about the development process. In the new year, I’ve resolved to attend &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/aral&#34;&gt;Aral Balkan&lt;/a&gt;‘s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.moderniosdevelopment.com/&#34;&gt;Modern iOS Development Workshop&lt;/a&gt; (I’ve heard so many good things.) But I don’t really see myself developing apps for a living, I find programming very difficult and not terribly rewarding, I just think my design decisions can be more well-informed as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;designing-for-free&#34;&gt;Designing for free&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above I said I wouldn’t work for free (shares) again. As a general rule, I wouldn’t recommend it, it’s a huge risk and chances are you’ll never make a return on the hours you put into the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my specific reason I wouldn’t work for free is that I believe people can often struggle to understand and appreciate the value in design if they’re not paying for it. They’ve not got an interest in getting the best value for money, so they don’t necessarily feel as though they should listen to what you say. In a way, the developer will always have the final say, as whatever they make is what gets released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’ve worked for free, and you’ve put so much time and effort into a project, you’re less likely to leave. The more time you spend, the more reluctant you’ll be to leave that all behind. It’s like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome&#34;&gt;Stockholm Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; of working for free. I still completely believe in Bardowl as a concept, and I have a huge amount of respect and love for our CEO and CTO, and that’s why I persist in trying to make my app design live up to the idea, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have frustrated times where a loss of control and startup politics infuriated me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;working-with-good-people&#34;&gt;Working with good people&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the occasional hiccups, I’ve found working with Bardowl immensely rewarding. There’s so much to be said about working for people who really believe and care about what they’re doing. It’s not just about doing design and development right, or business right, but about working with people right. Our CEO Chris Book is an example of somebody who cares about the people he works with. His role as CEO has often mean placating, convincing and cajoling, but he doesn’t just do this as a means to getting his app finished, he genuinely believes in providing value for those working on the project. And doing it all with honesty and transparency. Honesty and transparency are massively underrated.&lt;/p&gt;

        Great, open and honest post, I can sympathise with some of the long hours/low rewards just because you either love what you are building, or love the learning process of doing it :)
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hi!

I´m Ola, a swedish male voicetalent who loves audiobooks. I have looked at Bardowl and it seems great but there is one questionmark: why aren´t the books listed on the website?

There is a swedish company with exactly the same concept called Storytel.se, and the show all of their books and you can also manage your books on the site which is really handy.

Best

Ola&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>CreativeJS for non-coders workshop with Seb Lee-Delisle</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;programming-block&#34;&gt;Programming block&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a bit scared of JavaScript. Since I started learning front-end development about seven years ago, I’ve pretty much stayed away from it. That aside from some pretty dodgy jQuery where I can usually bodge something together but would never rely on it. I’ve always said it’s because I wanted to be &lt;em&gt;really really&lt;/em&gt; good at HTML first, and &lt;strong&gt;then&lt;/strong&gt; CSS and &lt;strong&gt;then&lt;/strong&gt; JavaScript, but I somehow always stopped short of actually learning JavaScript properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because I was scared of it. I might be able to put together some basic PHP when working with WordPress, but I really wouldn’t consider myself a programmer. The less that the code I’m writing has an instant visual output, the more I get confused by it. I’ve tried to learn all sorts of different languages but they always go in one ear and out the other. I had just settled for knowing enough to be able to know what the right solution should be and finding someone clever to help me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;there-s-a-lot-of-javascript-on-the-web&#34;&gt;There’s a lot of JavaScript on the web&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem was, that in doing this, I was really limiting myself. There’s a lot of JavaScript on the web. Even if you’re not using it to do something fancy on a site, if you’re a modern developer using progressive enhancement then chances are you’re using some kind of shiv or polyfill that relies on JavaScript. It’s pretty hypocritical of me if I go around saying I don’t use HTML and CSS frameworks, because writing all my own markup from scratch means I understand every little bit of it, when I don’t really understand the shivs and polyfills I’m using to help me use elements of HTML5 and CSS3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;creativejs-for-non-coders-workshop&#34;&gt;CreativeJS for non-coders workshop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://seb.ly&#34;&gt;Seb Lee-Delisle&lt;/a&gt; was putting on another couple of &lt;a href=&#34;http://seb.ly/training/&#34;&gt;workshops teaching CreativeJS&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone I’d known that had been to one of Seb’s workshops had said it was incredibly worthwhile and good fun. I didn’t have an excuse to put off learning JavaScript. And whilst I go to a lot of conferences, I’d not been to a proper two day workshop before so I wasn’t really sure what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;creativejs&#34;&gt;CreativeJS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seb has a creative angle on JavaScript as he’s really an artist who uses programming as one of his tools rather than a stereotypical ‘coder’. The whole workshop is based around learning how to create cool visual effects, interactive elements and animations rather than tedious examples of toggle menus and form validation. This really helped me get my head around the JavaScript we were using as it all had very visible, visual results. There was a practical use for all the code that we were taught, but we could play with it in more creative ways. Seb showed us loads of cool, complex examples of what other artists were doing with programming right at the beginning of the workshop and this helped deliver a good dose of inspiration into our heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;non-coder&#34;&gt;Non-coder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opted for the non-coder workshop (Seb also runs a more advanced CreativeJS and HTML5 2D workshop) as I really knew very little code. Whilst I could copy and paste a few things into something that vaguely works on the web, I didn’t really understand any of the core concepts of programming. This was the right choice for me as I continually felt challenged by the exercises set by Seb without feeling completely out of my depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-did-i-make&#34;&gt;So what did I make?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of two days, we played with a lot of fun demos and exercises, coding along with Seb and then being challenged to try new tasks out for ourselves. The part I’m most proud of is the Pong-like game that I created. I wrote every bit of this code by myself, some whilst following Seb’s instructions, and some by testing my knowledge of what I’d just been taught. This feels like a massive achievement for me, I don’t just feel like I’ve parroted a load of code, I feel like I &lt;strong&gt;actually understand it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://sebly.jsbin.com/icifow/5/embed?live&#34;&gt;View it on the CreativeJS graphics playground&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-another-thing-i-learnt&#34;&gt;And another thing I learnt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d previously always consider coding as something you did &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; design, but Seb’s workshop showed me that you can actually come up with new ideas just playing with the code. Just like in painting, drawing or designing, where you can have ‘happy accidents’, we seemed to frequently have these same serendipitous moments just mucking about with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-really-really-really-recommend-you-give-it-a-go&#34;&gt;I really really really recommend you give it a go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn JavaScript, or learn more creative ways to use your knowledge, I couldn’t recommend Seb’s workshops more. You can find out more on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://seb.ly/training/&#34;&gt;training section of Seb’s site&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ve just noticed he’s got another &lt;a href=&#34;http://seb.ly/training/&#34;&gt;CreativeJS for non-coders workshop on in December&lt;/a&gt; (that’d be a great early Christmas present!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even if you don’t end up going to a workshop, you should check out Seb’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://seb.ly/work/&#34;&gt;mad fun projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        I’ve been a designer and front-end developer for more than a few years and, like you, JavaScript confuses me. I’ve survived using many of the techniques you described above, but I have to admit that I don’t really know how the code I copy/paste is actually working. I’ve come to grips that I’ll likely never be ‘good’ at any programming language like PHP, but as a responsible front-ender I should at least be proficient at JavaScript.

I’ve been doing Codecademy and tinkering with JS more. You’ve completely sold me on Seb’s workshops! I’ll keep an eye out for next time he’ll be on my side of the pond.

Thanks for posting this. I feel less alone seeing someone like you going through some of the same things. Cheers!
    &lt;/div&gt;

        really nice and motivational post Laura! I live far from Sebs workshops, so i’m still waiting for the online version, but your comments made me really curious about it and a lot more hopefully about the js learning, thankss!
    &lt;/div&gt;
