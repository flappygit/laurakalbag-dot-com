	After winning the .net award two weeks ago, I really wasn’t expecting to win another award. Last night at a fun black tie, storybook-themed ubelly Critters awards, I won Next Big Thing.
 
Like before, I really wasn’t expecting it and made another bad speech, swore a little (I’m sorry!) and almost walked off without having my photo taken. I think you can tell I’m not used to this kind of thing… <a href="/the-critters-2013/">Read The Critters 2013</a>.

	I walk my dog Oskar every day, no matter what the weather. And usually it’s just him and me. So I’ve got this idea. A “web talk dog walk” where a group of us from the Brighton area can meet on a regular basis (probably fortnightly, maybe monthly) to walk dogs and chat about the web. Do you want to join us?
The first walk is 9am this Wednesday 12th June 2013 The best place to walk in the area (and conveniently near to where we live is East Brighton Park/Sheepcote valley. <a href="/web-talk-dog-walk/">Read Web talk dog walk</a>.

One of the reasons I jumped at the chance to speak at LXJS was their fantastic Code of Conduct. After hearing some horror stories from other women speakers, I wish more conferences had this sort of approach. It’s friendly, not strict, and lets everybody know where they stand.
The tickets are incredibly reasonable for a two-day event, and it looks like Lisbon is well-worth a holiday so a conference there is a bonus! <a href="/speaking-at-lxjs-in-portugal/">Read Speaking at LXJS in Portugal</a>.

There’s a huge amount of expert speakers across three days, with a day each dedicated to CSS3 Training, Advanced CSS and Preprocessors. I’m on the third day, covering the basics of Sass with ‘Sass for Designers’. The other talks on that day will cover Sass in more depth, with case studies and more advanced techniques, so I’m hoping to provide a useful introduction for those of us who are less familiar with programming. <a href="/css-summit-2013/">Read Sass For Designers at CSS Summit 2013</a>.

	I’ve changed my mind about this subject! To read about why and how I don’t believe this anymore, please read Women and conferences.
Business…Tech…Conferences… Every time I hear these dreaded phrases, “*Women in business*”, “*Women in tech*”, “*Women at conferences*” I just groan. It’s really boring.
Examples. “*There’s only x% of women at this conference*” or “There’s no female speakers at this conference.” Not just as observations (there’s nothing wrong in stating the obvious,) but saying it’s a negative point. <a href="/women-in/">Read Women in…</a>.

	Conferences are my social life As I go to more conferences, I meet more lovely people and get to see friends I’d only ever talk to on Twitter otherwise. In the last two years, I’ve been to about three a year and it feels about the right amount that you rarely see the same talk twice and it’s not just the same topics going round.
Again, I met loads of great people at New Adventures, but unfortunately missed more people than I meant to catch up with. <a href="/new-adventures-2011/">Read New Adventures 2011</a>.

	I’ve got a talk for Bathcamp 2010 in the works! Thanks to the ever-helpful Rich Quick for the idea, I’m going to do a talk on Design Tips for Developers.
However, alongside a bit of time, effort and available slot on the day, this is subject to some help from a kind developer. I’m looking for a bad design created by a developer to use as a case study. <a href="/bathcamp-plea-for-bad-designs-by-developers/">Read Bathcamp plea for bad designs by developers</a>.

	I was a bit skeptical about dConstruct at first. The idea of a conference based on ‘creativity and ideas’ made me worry it might be a bit pretentious but I was convinced by a lot of friends on Twitter that it’d be worthwhile, and they were so right.
I went with a notebook and an open mind. I didn’t want to go all reverse-snob on the pretentious (something I’m generally pretty guilty of being) and be ignorant of learning when I’d paid ££s for the pleasure. <a href="/dconstruct-2010/">Read dConstruct 2010</a>.
