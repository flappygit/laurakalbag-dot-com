	Last night I had a dream, or maybe a nightmare. I was in a ballet class in a church hall, learning all kinds of complicated and not-really-ballet dance sequences. The class was busy, we were all in clumsy rows. We were a diverse group of dancers in our everyday clothes. It was the same church hall I did most of my ballet classes in when I was younger, with lots of wood panelling, and stacked plastic chairs in place of a barre. <a href="/bereaved/">Read Bereaved</a>.

Ethical Design Manifesto refresh Last week we launched a refresh of the Ethical Design Manifesto, along with a video. As it was a short-ish video, I felt like I had no excuse but to do the captioning for it too. I couldn’t get Subtitle Horse (my usual favourite web software) working with the video, so I ended up using Jubler instead.
It took a while to get my head around how to use the interface, but I found using the audio track from the video very useful, as I could sync the subtitles to the wave forms. <a href="/diary-21st-march-2016/">Read Diary, 21st March 2016</a>.

	Well… we’re here! In Malmö, sitting in our new office at Media Evolution City.
It’s been a busy and exhausting week. Oskar and I made our 800 mile trip in one day, thanks to the wonderful “courier” and took another day to recover. Then it was straight into the office.
The last week has been meeting new friends, relocation admin, and arranging a few events for the year. All the while Aral has been coding. <a href="/diary-1st-march-2016/">Read Diary, 1st March 2016</a>.

	It’s nearly time! We’re moving to Sweden next Tuesday, and it’s currently at equal parts exciting and stressful.
The storage locker in Brighton is almost empty, and we’ve stashed all our sentimental stuff—the things you want to keep, but probably aren’t worth putting in a suitcase to a foreign land—at my family’s house. We’re only taking a couple of suitcases of clothes, our work equipment, and of course Oskar. If we can squeeze Aral’s fancy Anglepoise lamp and a few nice bits of artwork into the pet transportation van, then we’ll have those along too. <a href="/diary-16th-february-2016/">Read Diary, 16th February 2016</a>.

	Last week I wrote my Pastry Box thought on 5 reasons why you should get an office dog. It’s not just silly photos of Oskar, but actually five reasons why having Oskar for company has helped keep me sane. Through living and working by myself, to living and working with other people, he’s still incredibly valuable as a companion.

Faruk rightly says we all have the power and responsibility to make things better.
