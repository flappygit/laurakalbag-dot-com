	It’s been a few years since I wrote something for 24ways, but this year I’m back, making the case for semantic HTML.
 
As I mention in the article, I see a lot of redundant and unsemantic HTML while I’m working on Better. HTML is often seen as easy, and therefore not worth learning in detail. It’s frustrating because HTML is one of the few completely unavoidable technologies of the web. <a href="/semantic-html-on-24-ways/">Read Semantic HTML on 24 Ways</a>.

	After three years of work, I can finally tell you that I’ve written a book for A Book Apart about web accessibility called Accessibility For Everyone.
 
In case you’ve not heard of web accessibility (you wouldn’t be the first!), web accessibility is the degree to which a website is usable by as many people as possible. A lot of material around accessibility focus on making websites usable by people with different types of disabilities and impairments, but designing inclusively for a wide range of needs will generally make websites more usable for everyone. <a href="/accessibility-for-everyone/">Read Accessibility For Everyone</a>.

Ethical Design Manifesto refresh Last week we launched a refresh of the Ethical Design Manifesto, along with a video. As it was a short-ish video, I felt like I had no excuse but to do the captioning for it too. I couldn’t get Subtitle Horse (my usual favourite web software) working with the video, so I ended up using Jubler instead.
It took a while to get my head around how to use the interface, but I found using the audio track from the video very useful, as I could sync the subtitles to the wave forms. <a href="/diary-21st-march-2016/">Read Diary, 21st March 2016</a>.

	In the spirit of catching up on slightly older news, in January I was part of a panel commenting on BBC Taster on Creative Bloq.
Looking through, I liked the content and the concept interested me, but there were implications for accessibility that concerned me. Overall, I came across as a lot more cynical that the other designers and developers commenting on BBC Taster, but I think it’s important that we look at the bigger picture before we get caught up in the shiny. <a href="/bbc-taster/">Read What do web experts think of BBC Taster?</a>.

	Last October, Web Standards Sherpa published my mini series on Getting Started With Sass. It was a whole new experience as I’d never written a technical tutorial as in-depth as this, let alone doing so with a proper editor and technical editor. Web Standards Sherpa is like that; all about the quality. So it was sad to hear about Sherpa closing its doors this year. However, in order to keep the site and all its wonderful resources online forever, Web Standards Sherpa is hosting an online conference on the 23rd April, and I’m speaking. <a href="/speaking-at-the-sherpa-summit/">Read Speaking at the Sherpa Summit</a>.

	Recently I’ve been doing a lot of research in web accessibility, and it’s lead me to testing web pages more thoroughly. I’ve been testing keyboard-only navigation a lot. Keyboard-only input is how most screen reader users interact with the web, as well as many alternative input and mouse-less users.
This afternoon I was testing a new feature I want to add to Ind.ie’s accessible video player, and started moving down our style guide (work in progress! <a href="/skip-links/">Read Do your skip links work with keyboard navigation?</a>.

<div class="summary">
	<p>
	The reason I fell in love with the web was the democratisation of information. I love that so many people can access, learn, and share such a huge variety of resources. That’s why I’ve always considered accessibility so important. To me, access for all is an essential part of the nature of the web.
How I learned accessibility When I started to learn about web design and development, I learned from great books like Dan Cederholm’s Web Standards Solutions. <a href="/why-accessibility-matters-to-me/">Read Why accessibility matters to me #GAAD</a>.
