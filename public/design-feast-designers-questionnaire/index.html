<blockquote>
<p><strong>What are some of the challenges you encounter as a designer and how do you deal with them?</strong></p>

<p>I think the greatest challenge a designer comes across is their own ego. It’s in our nature, as those that deal in creativity, we have egos that allow us to consider our work good enough to share, and good enough for clients to pay us.</p>

<p>However, too much ego and we’d never iterate past our first draft of any design work, we’d never pay attention to client requirements, and we’d never allow anyone to tell us if we’re wrong. In my experience, my best work has been done when I’ve set my ego aside and worked collaboratively with clients and others.</p>
