<p>I started on the 12th December last year, with a quick sketch. I tried really hard and 9 days filled out with quick-ish sketches. The most detailed was the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;amp;q=fringe%20seahorse&amp;amp;tbs=imgo:1">Fringe-style seahorse</a> I drew the day after we finished watching the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_&amp;#40;TV_series&amp;#41;">Fringe</a> finale. I love drawing in biro, it’s got an interesting texture and roughness that allows me to be a bit scrawly and messy in a way that a rollerball pen or pencil doesn’t. Most of my sketches were off the top of my head, without looking up reference images (the Fringe seahorse is an exception). Most of my <a href="/types/illustration/">illustration work</a> is digital, so it feels very un-work-like to create something where the final outcome is a one-off on paper.</p>

</a>But then I had a big gap in my sketches. I left the days I missed blank, and did a mediocre sketch every week or so. Now I’ve got a lot of empty pages.</p>

<p>This week I wanted to draw a bird. That’s not something I could draw off the top of my head, so I looked up a reference image that had the detail I wanted to use. Then I drew it in a fair amount of detail. This probably took about 15 minutes. And I was quite happy with the results, finally there was another sketch I was happy with sharing online.</p>

</a></p>

<p>And this got me on a nature theme, I drew a squirrel, a starling and a frog in the following days. This was so much fun, and a satisfying distraction from my gloominess. Each sketch took progressively longer, but I don’t mind because I’m enjoying the process, and I’m doing it for me.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how I feel about creating work from other people’s reference photos. It feels like cheating somehow. I took the photo of the frog myself, so I was happier with that. I’d assemble my own still life structures, like we did at school, but I don’t think I could find subject matter anywhere near as interesting as the nature shots I can find on the web!</p>

<p>This morning I’ve been the most ambitious so far. I cracked open a box of watercolour pencils I got given. I’m not great at handling watercolour, as most of my painting has been done in acrylic, but I think this will be fun to improve on.</p>

</a></p>

<p>I’ve no idea if I’ll manage to get to 365 sketches. I want to go back and fill in the empty slots too, so I’ve got lots of work to do. It’s not something I want to become a chore, but it’s a nice excuse to improve my old-school drawing skills.</p>
