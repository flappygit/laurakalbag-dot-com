		<p>I was so busy last week that I forgot to post about <a href="http://unfinished.bz/81">Unfinished Business episode 81: Do you have a dinosaur onesie?</a> This week, Ashley and I recorded <a href="http://unfinished.bz/82">episode 82: Love a good pep talk</a>.</p>

<p>It’s been a fun few weeks. It’s been interesting how a lot of people have said that Ashley and I focused more on business-related topics than Andy’s recent episodes. That may well be the case, but it wasn’t really intentional, or because we think the podcast should be more business-focused. I love the informal, conversational style, and how (as a listener) I can keep up with the goings-on of the regular guests. There’s a lot more to business than the obvious topics.</p>

<p>I can’t speak for both Ashley and I, but I know that I was a bit scared of messing up the podcast, and so having some structured business-related topics made me feel a little more secure, and prevented me from rambling too much off topic!</p>

<p>I’ll be back for a handover episode with Andy this week, so I’m not going anywhere!</p>
