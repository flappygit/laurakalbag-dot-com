		<p><a href="http://unfinished.bz/72">This week’s episode of Unfinished Business</a> was great fun to record. After <a href="/indie-phone/" title="Becoming part of Indie Phone">my recent move to working on Indie Phone</a>, alongside my boyfriend Aral Balkan, I was curious to know how Andy and Sue have worked so well together since the beginning of Stuff and Nonsense.</p>

<p>I sent Sue some questions, which she answered and sent back to me, without Andy seeing the answers. During the show, I asked Andy about his thoughts and read Sue’s answers. Andy’s posted <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/hide-sharp-objects">the full list of questions and Sue’s answers on the Stuff and Nonsense blog</a>. After hearing so many stories about Stuff and Nonsense on Unfinished Business, I was expecting some funny answers. I wasn’t disappointed, but I was also struck about how kind, thoughtful and caring Andy and Sue are in their working relationship. That must be their secret to working together for so long!</p>
