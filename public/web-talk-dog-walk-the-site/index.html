<meta property="og:description" content="I’ve finally made a site for the web talk dog walks! It may be a small site, and is probably very broken in places, but it was a fun mini project and worked well as a case study for my Sass for designers talk.
It also makes use of Perch, that wonderful little content management system. I really would recommend it.

<p>I’ve finally made <a href="http://webtalkdogwalk.in/brighton/">a site for the web talk dog walks</a>! It may be a small site, and is probably very broken in places, but it was a fun mini project and worked well as a case study for my <a href="http://environmentsforhumans.com/2013/css-summit/">Sass for designers talk</a>.</p>
