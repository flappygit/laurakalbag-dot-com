<p>It’s also an all-new topic for me to share with other people, so I can’t wait! <a href="https://border-none.net/2014/tickets">Tickets for the whole 2-day event</a> are just 199 euros, and they have a really clever way of matching participants up with the topics they’re interested in, using <a href="https://border-none.net/2014/tickets#c67">an “aurora” of interests</a>. You really should come along.</p>
